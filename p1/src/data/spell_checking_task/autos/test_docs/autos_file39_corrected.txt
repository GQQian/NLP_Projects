Backup lamps on currant models are much brighter then they used to be on older cars . Those on my Taurus Wagon are quiet bright enough to illuminate a good area behind the car , and they're MUCH brighter then dozens on my earlier cars from the 60s a 70s . Insofar as Vettes having side backup lights , look at a ' 92 or ' 93 model ( or perhaps a year or to earlier to ) a you'll see red side marker lamps a white side marker lamps both near the car's hindquarters . Those aren't just white reflectors . Harv
