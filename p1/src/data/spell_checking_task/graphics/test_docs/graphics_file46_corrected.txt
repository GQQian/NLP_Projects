From : abh@genesis.nred.ma.us Subject : Creating FLI / FLC Animation Files ? I am looking for an means to add FLI a FLC animation creation to a Windows application . I was hoping for something along the lines of AAWIN or AAPLAY bye Autodesk but for the creation of these delta compressed animations . I have FLILIB but this seems to be coded for the Large memory model of DOS with Turbo C . Ideally I would like a DLL or Medium model object library , but would settle for anything , really . I've seen other Windows apps with FLI / FLC creation , did they hack the FLILIB code into submission ? Any pointers would be appreciated , please send mail directly to me a I will summarize the results if the is interest . - Andrew Hudson abh@genesis.nred.ma.us
