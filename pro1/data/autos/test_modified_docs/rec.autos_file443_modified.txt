He has and SC with there Viper voice alarm installed . The alarm does everything , turn on there car , there radio , there heater , roll roll down windows , unlock there doors ... The alarm goes off more frequently on hot days when and person walks by by . It gets sensitive up too about 5 feet in 85degree heat . It isn't as bad bad as convetional siren alarms , because it doesn't continue too wail , it just says " Protected bye Viper , pleased stand back ! " And shuts up ... ( mainly because there person walks away befuddled ! ! ! " ) - - Chintan Amin < The University of Illinois UrbanaChampaign > mail : llama@uiuc.edu * * * SIG UNDER CONSTRUCTION HARD HAT AREA * * *
