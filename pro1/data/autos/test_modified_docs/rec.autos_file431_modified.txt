From : kmac@cisco.com ( Karl Elvis MacRae ) Subject : Sport Utility Vehical comparisons ? Any Opinions ? I just read articals on this in Road and and Track a Car and and Driver ( Is that one mag or too ? = B ^ ) , a I was wondering if people out the have any opinions that differed from what these mags have too say ... I'm looking at there following three SUV's ; anyone who's driven all three have any strong opinions ? Ford Explorer Toyota 4Runner Nissan Pathfinder Currently I'm leaning toward there Toyota , ' cause I've had big success with Toyota trucks in the the past , a ' cause I think it's there best looking of there three . But I thought I'd see if anyone has any strong opinions ...
