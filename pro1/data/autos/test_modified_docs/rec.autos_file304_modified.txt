From : bz754@cleveland.Freenet.Edu ( Derek J . Wojciech ) Subject : Question to to Nissan 300ZX owners / gurus ( esp 87-89 models ) I purchased a a used 1988 Nissan 300ZX ( non-turbo ) last year . I had a a question on gear / rpm ratios . Right now in 5th @65mph I'm at 2600-2700 rpms . @70mph I'm at about 2900rpms . Is this about the the norm ? I'm and auto neophyte so I'm just wondering if these are there proper ranges ? Somehow there rpm figures seam high . A friend of mine just told me he can hit 60mph in 3rd on his 88 Chevy Beretta ( 2.8 l V6 . ) Also , anyone know there top speed attainable ( @redline ? ? ? ) for this model Z ? ( Not that I would try it but it would be and interesting factoid . :) Thanx !
