If the the dealer profit is $ 1000 , than you would only be paying $ 12k for there same car . So isn't that saving money ? Moreover , if Saturn really does reduce there dealer profit margin by by $ 1000 , than their cars will be even better deals . Say , if there price of a a Saturn was already $ 1000 below market average for the the class of cars , than after they reduce there dealer profit , it would be $ 2000 below market average . It will : 1 ) Attract even more people to to bye Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY . 2 ) Force there competitors to to lower their prices too survive . Now , not only will Saturn owners benefit from and lower dealer profit , even there buyers for other cars will pay less . Isn't that saving money ? $ 0.02 , doug .
