things . </s> <s> these commandments lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for criticizing ethical systems . </s> <s> what meaning they have comes from the ethical system the

bizarre to identify any one of these systems , however popular or infamous with christianity . </s> <s> christianity does not have a torah . </s> <s> it does not have a qu ran . </s> <s> specifically christian scripture has very little , if anything , in the way of commandments so little that the christians who desperately want commandments go mining for them with almost no support ... the one , single , thing in the gospels which jesus specifically gives as a commandment to us is love one another . </s> <s> jesus explicitly states that this summarizes jewish law , which would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what it means to love god and love our neighbors . </s> <s> there are many parables and teachings the gospels attribute to jesus that are straightforwardly read

what differentiates you is the way you interpret the gospel . </s> <s> ... why don t I and the myriads of other christians like me tell you something about christianity ? </s> <s> ... in a sense , the wide variety of interpretations does tell us something about christianity . </s> <s> it tells us that the new testament authors left a sufficiently vague hodge podge that it can serve as the source text for many , vastly different beliefs about the nature of the christian god and about what men should and shouldn t do . </s> <s> the irony here is that there is nothing in christianity per se that michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and gays . </s> <s> every christian principle he turns to this cause is effective only through the extra christian principles through which michael interprets his religion , and the homophobes apply the same christian principles , with equal justification , to their cause . </s> <s> in short , it is the extra christian principles that make michael s christianity beneficial , and I suspect they would be as beneficial , perhaps moreso , without being filtered by christian interpretation . </s> <s> michael paints a picture of standard american atheism as the rejection of the evil in many conservative christian interpretations of the bible . </s> <s> but I think it is even more damaging to christianity to note that the new testament presents such a vague hodge podge of notions about the nature of god and the nature of the good except , of course , when it is ordered by an interpretation that relies on extraneous principles . </s>

</s> <s> I note with some chagrin that baptist churches as a whole aren t really in a place to speak on this last point . </s> <s> the report concludes that masonry is not a religion , and says that

projection of god into the physical world , god incarnate . </s> <s> but there are some very important related facts that christians are completely ignorant of , as are followers of most other world religions . </s> <s> first , jesus christ was not unique , john 3 16 notwith standing . </s> <s> there is always at least one such divine master god incarnate physically alive in this world at all times , a continuous succession throughout history , both before and after the life of jesus . </s> <s> the followers of some of these masters founded the world s major religions , usually perverting the teachings of their master in the process . </s> <s> christians , for example , added threats of eternal damnation in hell , and deleted the teaching of reincarnation . </s> <s> secondly , and more importantly , after a particular master physically dies and leaves this world , there is nothing that he can do for anybody except for the relatively few people that he initiated while he was still physically alive . </s> <s> that is simply the way god set things up in the universes . </s> <s> therefore , all those christians who worship jesus , and pray to jesus , and expect jesus to return and save them from their sins , are only kidding themselves , and have allowed themselves to be duped by a religion that was mostly manufactured by the romans . </s> <s> and emotional feelings are a totally deceiving indicator for religious validity . </s> <s> these things are similarly true for followers of most other major world religions , including islam . </s> <s> thirdly , the primary function of each master is to tune his initiates into the audible life stream or sound current , referred to as the word in john 1 1 5 , and as the river of life in revelation 22 1 , and to personally guide each of them thru the upper levels of heaven while they are still connected to their living physical bodies by a silver cord . </s> <s> true salvation , which completes a soul s cycles of reincarnation in the physical and psychic planes , is achieved only by reaching at least the soul plane , which is five levels or universes above the physical universe , and this cannot be done

people who continue following christianity , islam , or other orthodox religions with a physically dead master , will continue on their cycles of reincarnation , between the psychic planes and this

kinds of evidence supporting reincarnation as a fact of life , including hypnotic regressions to past lives about 50 accurate the subconscious mind sometimes makes things up , especially with a bad

under persecution from the the big bad secular state what is your opinion of his reported sexual habits ? </s> <s> if the reports are accurate , what iyo does this say about the quality of his christianity ? </s> <s> or are the allegations just part of the big cover up ? </s> <s> thank you , steve . </s> <s> it is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being a christian . </s> <s> I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a conviction . </s> <s> I am not certain what you mean by the fundy part as the term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses . </s> <s> if you refer to those who actually believe jesus is the messiah and son of god and wish to follow in his way , then I plead guilty . </s> <s> but what does it matter what I think . </s> <s> the roman circus is over . </s> <s> the lions have been satisfied for now . </s> <s> the emperor , after the long and gruelling struggle , sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down . </s> <s> with respect to my previous comments about david koresh , I urge you to re examine my previous posts . </s> <s> I believe you mistakenly assume that defense of koresh right to his own personal beliefs and his right to express them to others implies agreement with koresh theology . </s> <s> actually I understand little about the details of branch davidian teachings and regret so many are hung up on that aspect of the tragic events of the past few days . </s> <s> nor do I think koresh sex life should be of any interest to the federal government . </s> <s> of course hillary says he had been molesting infants so it must be true even though such allegations do not fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government they are state and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the local level by proper authorities with no successful charge having ever been levied against him . </s> <s> under american law , he was innocent as americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty . </s> <s> at least that s how it is suppposed to be . </s> <s> but he was demonized and propa gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a lustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might bring upon him . </s> <s> but evidence trickles in that the twenty one children , who left the building in the early days of the siege , were carefully examined by qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse and none was found . </s> <s> deguerin , one of the attorneys who met with davidians several times before the conflagration , reported that the children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse . </s> <s> ultimately , steve , what I think about the heart of david koresh is quite unimportant . </s> <s> today he is in the benevolent hands of a most wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all . </s> <s> so I withhold any judgment of david koresh and defer to the one who has all knowledge . </s> <s> meanwhile , let s clean up the mess left on earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong message to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the people it serves . </s> <s> joe gaut I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire I wouldn t put it past koresh to have torched the place himself . </s> <s> on the other hand , if the propane tank accident story is correct , I wouldn t put it past the fbi to try to cover its ass by claiming koresh did it . </s> <s> I hope your government does a very thorough investigation of the whole debacle , and I ll be disappointed if a few heads don t roll . </s> <s> the authorities seem to have botched the original raid , and in the matter of the fire , are guilty of either serious misjudgement , or reckless endangerment . </s> <s> steve watson a .

that is it what jesus is getting at . </s> <s> no big surprise . </s> <s> feelings do not even enter the picture . </s> <s> consider jesus s use of the word guilt as how a court uses it . </s> <s> jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being imperfect . </s> <s> the bible calls it the state that we are all sinners . </s> <s> we all do bad things . </s> <s> even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our guilt that we are all sinners . </s> <s> it is it in our nature to do bad things . </s> <s> we are sinners , therefore we do bad things .

</s> <s> that isn t new to him . </s> <s> it is no big deal to him . </s> <s> he just wants you to realize that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him . </s> <s> that is what he wants you to know . </s> <s> why , because he wants to have your company . </s> <s> you are immensely valuable to him . </s> <s> jesus wants a relationship with you , however , in our present sinful nature , we are incapable of having this relationship . </s> <s> god is perfect . </s> <s> we are not . </s> <s> you cannot fit a square peg into a round hole . </s> <s> however , god has provided a way for us to change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him . </s> <s> god has provided jesus , so that whosoever just believes in jesus , will have their nature changed . </s> <s> the holy spirit will move it . </s> <s> and now divine nature is now within lives our very being and us and god communicate with each through his unifying holy spirit . </s> <s> the benefits of this are endless . </s> <s> for with the divine nature living within us , we can now see our imperfections better . </s> <s> we can now head them off at the pass . </s> <s> with the power of the holy spirit living in us , we now have his power to help us overcome our shortcomings . </s> <s> because the divine nature lives within us , we can now understand profound bible passages that never

we have eternal life for the holy spirit is eternal . </s> <s> the relationship with jesus is of the utmost importance . </s> <s> because it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to heavenly kingdom , it is your relationship to the living god . </s> <s> remember what jesus said at the tail end of matthew when he separated the goats from the sheep . </s> <s> many people in the last day will ask him , didn t I prophesy in your name and do miracles , and do good things in your name ? </s> <s> and what did jesus say ? </s> <s> depart from me , for I never knew you . </s> <s> that is the cornerstone of christianity , kent . </s> <s> jesus must know you as his friend . </s> <s> it is your relationship to jesus . </s> <s> if he is your friend and you are his , you will be

this huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder . </s> <s> good . </s> <s> it shows that you have a strong self image that you love yourself . </s> <s> that is the second greatest commandment jesus taught . </s> <s> if only more people could do as you do . </s> <s> as I said before , in the common english venacular , feeling guilty has a different meaning than the state of guilt . </s> <s> this all is a very clear indication that you need a certain personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain religious doctrines . </s> <s> and if your personality type is opposite , then you are not that easily attached to a certain world view system . </s> <s> I believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego , a lot less self centeredness , and a lot more unconditional love

butler subject re new biblical contradictions still not answered judas mr decenso , in spite of requiring scholarly opinion on the hanging of judas , rejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases those scholars opinion on the subject ... we do know from matthew that he did hang himself and acts probably records his death . </s> <s> although it s possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks , thereby bursting open , I can no longer assume that to be the case . </s> <s> therefore , no contradiction . </s> <s> matthew did not say judas died as a result of the hanging , did he ? </s> <s> most scholars believe he iprobably did , but .. ? </s> <s> I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars explanations , but in looking at the texts initially , we can t assume judas died . </s> <s> it is , however , highly probable . </s> <s> and also , there is nothing in the greek to suggest success or failure . </s> <s> it simply means hang oneself . </s> <s> actually , if you do further research as to the greek word apacgw , you will find that it does denote success . </s> <s> those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was successful . </s> <s> as I pointed out , I recently checked several lexicons greek english lexicon of the new testament , louw and nida robinson s greek and english lexicon of the new testament greek english lexicon of the new testament , grimm word study concordance , tynsdale a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other early christian writings , bauer arndt gingrich the new analytical greek lexicon , perschbacher a couple simply stated hanged oneself , and a couple were more explicit and stated that apacgw means specifically kill yourself by hanging . </s> <s> a couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for apacgw is strangle , throttle or choke which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to david joslin that judas was hung upside down . </s> <s> one of the best references though , robinson s greek and english lexicon of the new testament , not only stated the translation , it gave both the root words , the literal translation , related greek words which use the same roots , and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature to give further context . </s> <s> the word apagchw has two root words gchw is the to strangle root , and the root word apo means literally away . </s> <s> this root words is included in words which denote a transition . </s> <s> it can mean a transition in place eg the greek word apagello means to send a message . </s> <s> apo can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death . </s> <s> robinson specifically makes comparison to the word apokteiuo , which means to kill . </s> <s> in literal meaning the word apacgw means to throttle , strangle to put out of the way , and implicitly denotes a change in life state ie away from life , to death . </s> <s> so while the word apacgw does mean to hang , it specifically denotes a death as well . </s> <s> thus robinson is quite specific when he state that it means to hang oneself , to end one s life by hanging . </s> <s> he then notes the the use of apacgw in homers odessy 19 230 to denote context . </s> <s> he presents that example of apacgw as being used to explicitly mean suicide by hanging . </s> <s> now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling , without the added denotation of death , and as you insist that the bible was written by god , and every word is precicely correct , you are stuck with the complete meaning of apacgw ie since the word apacgw was used , then death is denoted as the result . </s> <s> by the way , I note that mr decenso also presents an example of apacgw in the septuagint the greek translation of the ot used at the time of jesus , it s only used in 2 samuel 17 23 now when ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed , he saddled a donkey , and arose and went home to his house , to his city . </s> <s> then he put his household in order , and hanged himself , and died and he was buried in

doubt of the result . </s> <s> in matthew , we are not explicitly told judas died . </s> <s> note mr decenso , as you say , the septuagint was a translation from hebrew to greek , and you have not shown the original meaning of the hebrew ie the the hebrew say and died , and thus whether it was simply echoed in the greek . </s> <s> it should also be pointed out that , regardless of the added and died , the correct translation would still be apacgw , as the man did indeed die from strangulation redundant , but correct . </s> <s> further , we have evidence that the septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited which included versions which contradicted each other , and such editing was not even necessarily executed by greeks . </s> <s> thus I am not sure that you can use the septuagint as it now stands , as a paragon of ancient greek . </s> <s> so , what you really need to prove your point mr decenso , is an example , in ancient greek , of someone committing apacgw and surviving . </s> <s> otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence . </s> <s> now I would note mr decenso , that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis , I pretty much find it false . </s> <s> thus , I think that if you are going to add to the text , something over and above what the source clearly says , then you had better have an explicit greek or historical source to justify it . </s> <s> by the way , as to mr rose s statement about trees around the potter s field there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom . </s> <s> unless mr rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old , or that there are 2000 year old stumps there , or has a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees , then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago after all , things change . </s> <s> now as to your other argument , ie that the money judas used is not the same as the 30 silvers as to your second question mr decenso , you ask how we could be sure that the money with which judas purchased the land , was indeed for the betrayal , rather than some other source . </s> <s> I would point out that in acts , where it specifically mention the reward of iniquity acts 1 18 , it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about ie acts 1 16 ... concerning judas who was guide to those who arrested jesus . </s> <s> . </s> <s> now I would point out that when the bible describes an act of iniquity , and then immediately discusses the reward of iniquity , it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed . </s> <s> notice that in verse 16 , the word iniquity is not used . </s> <s> rather , it states that judas became a guide to those who arrested jesus . </s> <s> but the writer did not stop there ... vs . </s> <s> 17 , for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry . </s> <s> what part did judas play in their ministry ? </s> <s> true , peter or the author of acts does not specifically call judas betrayal an iniquity , but for that matter , neither does john specifically call judas actions an iniquity either . </s> <s> further john 13 29 did not say that judas took the money box , but rather said some thought that because , judas had the money box , jesus was telling him buy what we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor , so after receiving the morsel he immediately went out , and it was night . </s> <s> note that it is said that judas left , it does not say that he took the money box . </s> <s> thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity , mentioned by another author , in a different book , written at a different time , over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts . </s> <s> I find this forced and contrived . </s> <s> of course this particular argument becomes moot , since we have have seen evidence that apacgw means suicide . </s> <s> you see , since judas hanging was successful , he could not have spent the money mentioned in john 13 29 , because matthew and mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day ie passover , and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day . </s> <s> thus the money which bought the field of blood would have to have been the 30 pieces of silver of course he got the 30 pieces of silver that night as well , and thus couldn t have spent that either . </s> <s> oh dear , I believe that the house of cards is comming down . </s> <s> maybe we should at this point , discuss now whether jesus was crucified on friday or saturday as that is now part of the argument about judas . </s> <s> by the way , as to where the prophesy of the potter s field came from ie the mention of it in matthew , you say please , when we are done with this study on his death , remind me to discuss this with you . </s> <s> I am reminding you now to discuss it now . </s>

<s> I was wrong . </s> <s> I admit that I do not have a handle on greek grammar , and thus confused kleros , the second to last word in acts 1 17 as being the plot of land discussed . </s> <s> in

first assumed it is not nontrivial by any means , and I still am not competent with it , but it is not as opaque as I had thought . </s> <s> it turns out that while the index for the bauer arndt
