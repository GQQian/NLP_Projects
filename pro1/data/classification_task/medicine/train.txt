blooms occuring after broad spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body . </s> <s> I do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice . </s> <s> nor is it mine . </s> <s> what I tried to explain to marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections . </s> <s> marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists . </s> <s> anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this . </s> <s> at some centers pre op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt to

</s> <s> however , it is not part of my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after antibiotics . </s> <s> I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients . </s> <s> whether or not it is a logical extension from the available observations I ll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations

recently bought from the self care catalog . </s> <s> I am very pleased with the results . </s> <s> the catalog description is as follows the pressure point massager is an aggressive physical massager that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a professional shiatsu masseur . </s> <s> the powerful motor drives two counter rotating thumbs that move in one inch orbits releasing tension in the neck , back , legs and arms . </s> <s> pressure point massager a2623 109 to order or receive a catalog , call 24 hours , 7 days 1 800 345 3371 or fax at 1 800 345 4021 . </s> <s> note when I ordered the massager , the item number was different , and the price was 179 , not 109 . </s> <s> when I received it , I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one . </s> <s> I was quite annoyed to see a 70 difference in price . </s> <s> I called them about it , and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers , although it looks and works exactly the same . </s> <s> he told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one , using the price difference as a reason for return . </s> <s> in fact , since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory I received this one in 3 days , he told me I could use the one I already have until the new one arrives , then return the old one . </s> <s> very reasonable people . </s> <s> I have long term neck , shoulder and back pain if I were a building , I would be described as structurally unsound . </s> <s> I have stretches and exercises to do that help , but the problem never really goes away . </s> <s> if , for whatever reason , I do not exercise for a while illness , not enough time , lazy , etc . </s> <s> , the muscles become quite stiff and painful and , thus , more prone to further strain . </s> <s> even with exercise , I sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track , which 1st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p . </s> <s> t . </s> <s> the tension in my neck , if not released , eventually causes a headache sometimes confused with a sinus headache over my left eye . </s> <s> when my physical therapist has massaged my neck , and the sub occipital muscles in particular the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull , the headache usually eased within a day , although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged . </s> <s> I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent a machine that would massage , not vibrate , my neck and sub occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past , that I could use by myself . </s> <s> no doctor visit or inconvenient p . </s> <s> t . </s> <s> appts for a week later would be needed to use it . </s> <s> I could get up in the middle of the night and use it , if necessary . </s> <s> I have been using it for about a week or so now , and love it . </s> <s> the base unit is about a 14 x 9 rectangle , about 3 3 4 high , with handles on each side , and it plugs into an average outlet . </s> <s> the two metal thumbs are about 1 1 2 in diameter and protrude about 2 1 2 above the base . </s> <s> the thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non removable . </s> <s> they are located more toward one end , rather than centered see figure below . </s> <s> they move in either clockwise or counter clockwise directions , depending on which side of the switch is pushed , and are very quiet . </s> <s> it can be used from either side . </s> <s> for instance , the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck , depending on which direction you approach it . </s> <s> for the neck head , the user varies the amount of pressure used by if laying down allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and or neck to rest on the thumbs . </s> <s> the handles can also be used if sitting or standing , applying pressure with the arms wrists . </s> <s> since my wrists are also impaired I m typing this over an extended period of time , and I don t have someone living with me who can apply it , laying down works well for me . </s> <s> for my back , I sit in a high backed kitchen chair , position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged , and lean back lightly or not so lightly against it . </s> <s> the pressure of leaning back holds it in place . </s> <s> if I want to massage the entire spine , I simply move it down a few inches whenever I feel like it . </s> <s> for my back , this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used home made massager of 2 tennis balls taped together with the balls , position against a wall or door them over the spine and move the body up and down against them . </s> <s> the tennis balls are better than nothing , but difficult to use for very long , especially if your quads are not in good shape , and my long hair gets painfully in the way if I don t pin it up first . </s> <s> as far as I m concerned , the easier something like this is to use , the more likely I ll use do it . </s> <s> if there are multiple considerations hassles , I m more likely to not bother with it . </s> <s> not only has this machine helped with my headaches , but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased . </s> <s> the first time I used it on my neck sub occipital muscles , however , I overdid it and pressed too hard against it , which resulted in a very tender , almost bruised area for a few days . </s> <s> I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice , which helped . </s> <s> after that , I was more gradual about applying pressure . </s> <s> at this point , the pain in the sub occipital area is now minimal while being massaged . </s> <s> I also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back , which is the most vulnerable point for me . </s> <s> it also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades , although , again , it took a few days of massaging just a few minutes at a time to really work it out . </s> <s> I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems , although I cannot vouch for its durability it seems pretty sturdy , since I ve had it such a short time . </s> <s> I plan to use it not only to ease tension , but also to loosen the muscls before exercising and maybe after , too . </s> <s> I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks , so this was very timely for me . </s> <s> this is the 1st product I ve ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co worker . </s> <s> the catalog states they have been in business since 1976 . </s> <s> it contains quite a few health care products and , while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products , they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do . </s> <s> definitely a step above some other ones I ve seen such as dr . </s> <s> leonards health care catalog or mature wisdom . </s> <s> I m only 37 , but have ended up on some geriatric type mailing lists no big surprise here . </s> <s> I consider many of those products to be rip offs , particularly targeted toward the elderly , with dubious health benefits . </s> <s> I apologize for the length of this , but it s the kind of info I would like to know before ordering

the actual distinction between the two conditions is often fairly fuzzy as well . </s> <s> I beg to differ . </s> <s> chronic active hepatitis implies that the disease remains active , and generally leads to liver failure . </s> <s> at the very minimum , the patient has persistently elevated liver enzymes what some call transaminitis . </s> <s> chronic persistant hepatitis simply means that the patient has hbsag in his her blood and can transmit the infection , but shows no evidence of progressive disease . </s> <s> if I had to choose , I d much rather have the persistant type . </s> <s> being a chronic hbsag carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic persistent anything . </s> <s> persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical , biochemical , or histologic evidence of liver disease , or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis , chronic active hepatitis , cirrhosis , or hepatocellular carcinoma . </s> <s> most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis cph are probably the result of a viral infection , although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be determined . </s> <s> the diagnosis of cph is made on the basis of liver biopsy . </s> <s> it consists of findings of portal inflammation , an intact periportal limiting plate , and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis . </s> <s> but in contrast to chronic active hepatitis cah there is no periportal inflammation , bridging necrosis , or fibrosis . </s> <s> cph has , indeed , an excellent prognosis . </s> <s> if I had to choose between cah and cph there is no question I

medical study on the disease , a flu like illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in rare instances death . </s> <s> the decision last week has put property owners on notice

found that the workers contracted the disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job . </s> <s> he ordered the new york state owned commuter line to pay the workers more than 560,000 to

disease throughout the country it s most prevalent in new england , the middle atlantic states , wisconsin , minnesota and the northwest may make this particular insect bite a particularly litigious one . </s> <s> the illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will cover and medical malpractice claims against

compensation cases , however , are limited to medical costs and lost earnings . </s> <s> the case before judge ward dealt with a potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages , because it involved the question of negligence . </s> <s> unlike the worker s compensation process , the law governing injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and , as a result , for

property owners to protect against lyme disease . </s> <s> lawyers caution that despite judge ward s decision , winning a lawsuit for damages caused by lyme disease may prove difficult . </s> <s> for one thing , victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when and where they got the tick bite . </s> <s> judge ward found that the plaintiffs in the railroad case got lyme disease while working on property owned by the railroad , even though none of the men remembered being bitten . </s> <s> the workers , who weren t outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to the insects , said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded some work sites . </s> <s> a spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is considering an appeal . </s> <s> the railroad also disputes judge ward s finding that it didn t do enough to protect employees . </s> <s> the spokeswoman says the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special pants to protect against bug bites . </s> <s> debate in the scientific community over lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners , such as questioning whether a victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness . </s> <s> earlier this week , the journal of the american medical association reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having lyme disease . </s> <s> and damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical disputes over the degree of harm that lyme disease causes . </s> <s> because of

fulk writes what is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhaps even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds . </s> <s> flights of fancy , and other irrational approaches , are common . </s> <s> the crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren t of any use unless they make you do some experiments . </s> <s> I ve known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they won t admit out loud what the fantasy was , prior to the consumption of a few beers . </s> <s> simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dna electrophoresis gel of human alu fragments . </s> <s> he got very excited , hoping that he d seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes . </s> <s> this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays . </s> <s> the result was a well conserved , 400 or so bp , sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome . </s> <s> unfortunately for warren s fantasy , it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome . </s> <s> on the other hand , the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized and the standard method of recognizing human dna was created . </s> <s> other species have different sets of transposons . </s> <s> fortunately for me , warren and I used to eat dinner at t . </s> <s> g . </s> <s> I . </s> <s> fridays all the time . </s> <s> it further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes forward and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs by generating in a completely non rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the critical function of science . </s> <s> I m not sure that it s random . </s> <s> but there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses . </s> <s> if you are really working in an unknown area , it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true under those circumstances , the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have . </s> <s> if they are wrong , you will find out soon enough but at least , you will find out something . </s> <s> if you try to do experiments at random , with no prior conceptions at all in mind , you will probably get nowhere . </s> <s> though why this critical function should be less subject to the non rational forces is a mystery . </s> <s> unfortunately , the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non rational forces . </s> <s> then we get varieties of pathological science lysenko , mirsky s opposition to dna as gene , cold fusion , and so forth . </s> <s> if experimental design , hypotheses creation , and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds , then this must be equally true of the application of any critical function concerning replication . </s> <s> this is what leads one ala feyerabend to an anything goes view . </s> <s> I don t agree that this follows . </s> <s> in fact , this is exactly the point at which I disagree with feyerabend . </s> <s> it is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one s jealousies out of the refereeing process . </s> <s> failures there are aplenty , but , on the whole , things work out . </s> <s> another point there are a couple of senses of the phrase experimental design . </s> <s> I d say that the less rational part is in experimental choice , not design . </s> <s> alexander fleming proc . </s> <s> royal soc . </s> <s> , 1922 chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons

instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one s political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science . </s> <s> it is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs . </s> <s> irrational . </s> <s> perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons , or interesting new

and adding some compression to try and help out in noisy situations . </s> <s> the major difference in the resound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies splitting point is programmable , apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies , while the important consonant information unfortunately for me is in the high frequencies . </s> <s> the two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable . </s> <s> they have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call abnormal growth of loudness . </s> <s> this latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience , though I think the phrase is missleading . </s> <s> what appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss , the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the too loud point the sensitivity curves appear to converge . </s> <s> this means that if you just boost all sound levels , you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses . </s> <s> hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point . </s> <s> you want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls off a cliff . </s> <s> aids with simple compressors don t descriminate between energy in the

sinus endoscopy I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly , motrin at the time , I seemed to get a lot of migraines . </s> <s> but had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here . </s> <s> I generally don t take nsaids or tylenol for headaches , because I ve found them to be ineffective . </s> <s> however , I have two other pain sources that force me to take nsaids currently naprosyn . </s> <s> first , is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period , and then much worse at midcycle . </s> <s> I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past 12 years ago , so the drs . </s> <s> tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back . </s> <s> I ve tried synarel , it reduced the pain while I took it 3 mos , but the pain returned immediately after I stopped . </s> <s> three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only real solution to my problem . </s> <s> although I don t expect to have any more children , I don t like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis . </s> <s> one of the drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery , but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children . </s> <s> so basically all I m left with is toughing out the pain . </s> <s> this would be impossible without naprosyn or something similar but not aspirin , that doesn t work , and motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago , so I m through with it . </s> <s> in fact , naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain and pain in both legs as I ll discuss in a moment . </s> <s> generally though , I wait until I have the pain before I take the naprosyn , but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain it s actually quite effective at reducing the pain , it just takes quite a while . </s> <s> in the meantime I m frequently in severe pain . </s> <s> the other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy . </s> <s> I ve had mris , xrays , ct scan , and emgs I ve had 2 of them , and don t intend to ever do that again with nerve conduction tests . </s> <s> the tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain . </s> <s> the mri reports both say I have several bulging , degeneratig disks , and from the xrays and mri , I think it is apparent that I have arthritis . </s> <s> the reading on the ct scan was that there are two herniations l3 l4 , and l4 l5 , but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations . </s> <s> the second emg and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first emg . </s> <s> oh yeah , I had some other horrible test , called something like somatic evoked response which showed that the internal nerves are working fine . </s> <s> anyway , the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain . </s> <s> the back pain is there all the time , but I can live with it . </s> <s> when the leg pain is there , I need some analgesic anti inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work . </s> <s> so I took naprosyn regulary for 6 9 months every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse , so I d always resume . </s> <s> since last november I have taken it much less frequently , and primarily for the pelvic pain . </s> <s> I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months 2 3 times a week . </s> <s> after the first month or so , my therapist put me on pelvic traction she had tried it earlier , but it had caused a lot of pain in my back , this time she tried it at a lower weight . </s> <s> after a month or two , the pain in my legs began going away but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back , which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage . </s> <s> so now , I don t have nearly as much pain in my legs , in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago . </s> <s> getting back to my original reason for this post ... even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches , I really can t avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources , that force me to use them oh , I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery , but I m avoiding that too . </s> <s> I find the migraines difficult to deal with , occassionally I have to take off work , but usually I can work , but at a reduced capacity I m a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing . </s> <s> when the pelvic pain is bad , I can t concentrate much , I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes , because the pain is so bothersome . </s> <s> when the pain in my back is bad , it can cause severe burning in both legs , shooting pains in my legs , electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes , and basically when it gets bad I can t really sit at all . </s> <s> then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed . </s> <s> so even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines , the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources . </s> <s> I get a lot of migraines , an average of 3 to 4 a month , which last 1 3 days . </s> <s> I ve taken cafergot the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage , but I don t like the side effects if I take more than two I get diahrea . </s> <s> if I get a very bad headache , I will eventually take the cafergot . </s> <s> my neurologist wasn t very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot , he said that when sumatriptan becomes available , I should try that . </s> <s> I ve tried several other medications fiornal , midrin , fiornal with codeine , tegretol , and inderal but they either didn t work , or I couldn t tolerate them . </s> <s> so what can I do ? </s> <s> my doctor s seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain , which I agree with most of the time , but not when I have a lot of pain . </s> <s> I ve had some bad experiences with surgery my heart stopped once from the anesthesia I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine , and I ve already had surgery several times . </s> <s> anyway , the point of what I m saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines , some people need to take them to tolerate other pain . </s> <s> janice rathmannsubject teenage acne pat churchill my 14 y o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy

deliveries . </s> <s> since the early 1970s , the number and percentage of births to older women increased however , if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained the same as in 1986 , the

rate in the united states steadily increased from 1965 through 1986 however , the findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since 1986 3 . </s> <s> because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth , a national health objective for the year 2000 4 is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries objective 14.8 . </s> <s> postpartum complications including urinary tract and wound infections may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births 5 . </s> <s> moreover , the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health care costs . </s> <s> for example , in 1991 , the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were 7826 and 4720 , respectively . </s> <s> the additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes 611 for physician fees and 2495 for hospital charges 6 . </s> <s> if the cesarean rate in 1991 had been 15 the year 2000 objective instead of 23.5 ,

steady increase in vbac rates since 1986 , several factors may impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean delivery . </s> <s> for example , vbac rates substantially

prior cesarean , regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted . </s> <s> to reach the overall cesarean rate goal , however , increases in the vbac rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate . </s> <s> one hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery , by requiring a second opinion , and by instituting a peer review process 10 . </s> <s> other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries public dissemination of physician and hospital specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of

workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of hiv , to establish a universal terminology for hiv associated oral lesions , to look for more

therapy on oral lesions . </s> <s> epidemiology since the first international workshop on oral manifestations of hiv infection was convened five years ago , the epidemiology of hiv infection has

focused on changing the public s attitude that aids is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use . </s> <s> speakers also addressed health care delivery for hiv infected patients , and the need to educate the public about what aids is , and how it is acquired . </s> <s> saliva and salivary glands conference speakers described transmission issues and the hiv inhibitory activity of saliva , the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions . </s> <s> whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions , which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions . </s> <s> research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity . </s> <s> they attributed the hiv inhibitory effect of saliva to the 1 aggregation agglutination of hiv by saliva , which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell , and 2 direct effects on the virus or target cells . </s> <s> other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in hiv infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity . </s> <s> pediatric issues pediatric aids recently has emerged as an area of intense interest . </s> <s> with early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment , the life expectancy of hiv infected children has tripled . </s> <s> the

the tension in my neck , if not released , eventually causes a headache sometimes confused with a sinus headache over my left eye . </s>  <s> when my physical therapist has massaged my neck , and the sub occipital muscles in particular the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull , the headache usually eased within a day , although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged . </s>  <s> I

has done in the past , that I could use by myself . </s>  <s> no doctor visit or inconvenient p . </s>  <s> t . </s>  <s> appts for a week later would be needed to use it . </s>  <s> I could get up in

with a gray cloth that is non removable . </s>  <s> they are located more toward one end , rather than centered see figure below . </s>  <s> they move in either clockwise or counter clockwise directions , depending on which side of the switch is pushed , and are very quiet . </s>  <s> it can be used from either side . </s>  <s> for instance , the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck , depending on which direction you approach it . </s>  <s> for the neck head , the user varies the amount of pressure used by if laying down allowing all or part of the

 <s> if I want to massage the entire spine , I simply move it down a few inches whenever I feel like it . </s>  <s> for my back , this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used home made massager of 2 tennis balls taped together with the balls , position against a wall or door them over the spine and move the body up and down against them . </s>  <s> the tennis balls are better than nothing , but difficult to use for very long , especially if your quads are not in good shape , and my long hair gets painfully in the way if I don t pin it up first . </s>  <s> as far as I m concerned , the easier something like this is to use , the more likely I ll use do it . </s>  <s> if there are multiple considerations hassles , I m more likely to not bother with it . </s>  <s> not only has this machine helped with my headaches , but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased . </s>  <s> the first time I used it on my neck sub occipital muscles , however , I overdid it and pressed too hard against it , which resulted in a very tender , almost bruised area for a few days . </s>  <s> I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice , which helped . </s>  <s> after that , I was more gradual about applying pressure . </s>  <s> at this point , the pain in the sub occipital area is now minimal while being massaged . </s>  <s> I also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back , which is the most vulnerable point for me . </s>  <s> it also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades , although , again , it took a few days of massaging just a few minutes at a time to really work it out . </s>  <s> I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems , although I cannot vouch for its durability it seems pretty sturdy , since I ve had it such a short time . </s>  <s> I plan to use it not only to ease tension , but also to loosen the muscls before exercising and maybe after , too . </s>  <s> I have been ill

what is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhaps even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds . </s>  <s> flights of fancy , and other irrational approaches , are common . </s>  <s> the crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren t of any use unless they make you do some experiments . </s>  <s> I ve known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they won t admit out loud what the fantasy was , prior to the consumption of a few beers . </s>  <s> simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dna electrophoresis gel of human alu fragments . </s>  <s> he got very excited , hoping that he d seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes . </s>  <s> this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays . </s>  <s> the result was a well conserved , 400 or so bp , sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome . </s>  <s> unfortunately for warren s fantasy , it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome . </s>  <s> on the other hand , the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized and the standard method of recognizing human dna was created . </s>  <s>

further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes forward and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs by generating in a completely non rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the critical function of science . </s>  <s> I m not sure that it s random . </s>  <s> but there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses . </s>  <s> if you are really working in an unknown area , it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true under those circumstances , the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have . </s>  <s> if they are wrong , you will find out soon enough but at least , you will find out something . </s>  <s> if you try to do experiments at random , with no prior conceptions at all in mind , you will probably get nowhere . </s>  <s> though why this critical function should be less subject to the non rational forces is a mystery . </s>  <s> unfortunately , the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non rational forces . </s>  <s> then we get varieties of pathological science lysenko , mirsky s opposition to dna as gene , cold fusion , and so forth . </s>  <s> if experimental design , hypotheses creation , and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds , then this must be equally true of the application of any critical function concerning replication . </s>  <s> this is what leads one ala feyerabend to an anything goes view . </s>  <s> I don t agree that this follows . </s>  <s> in fact , this is exactly the point at which I disagree with feyerabend . </s>  <s> it is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one s jealousies out of the refereeing process . </s>  <s> failures there are aplenty , but , on the whole , things work out . </s>  <s> another point there are a couple of senses of the phrase experimental design .

treated with different compression schemes which are programable . </s>  <s> they have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call abnormal growth of loudness . </s>  <s> this

with hearing loss , the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the too loud point the sensitivity curves appear to converge . </s>  <s> this means that if
