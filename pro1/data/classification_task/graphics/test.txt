research , system development and teaching . </s> <s> it handles sequences of images movies in precisely the same manner as single frames . </s> <s> programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations , filtering , convolution , fourier and other transform processing , edge detection and line drawing manipulation , digital image compression and transmission methods ,

performed quickly and conveniently . </s> <s> additionally , hips allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines . </s> <s> new users become effective using hips on their first day . </s> <s> hips features images that are self documenting . </s> <s> each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image . </s> <s> hips includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header , and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of unix filters . </s> <s> it comes complete
