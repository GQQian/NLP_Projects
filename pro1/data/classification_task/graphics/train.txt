is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional , I . </s>  <s> e . </s>  <s> only extant between the edges , but which exists in three dimensional space . </s>  <s> to draw the object we 1 fit a cubic spline through the points . </s>  <s> each spline is effectively computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the curve . </s>  <s> each spline has an equal number of segments . </s>  <s> we assume that the nth segment along each spline is roughly , but not exactly , the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure . </s>  <s> 2 take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the opposing spline . </s>  <s> use the pair of segments to form two triangles which will be filled in to color the surface . </s>  <s> 3 depth sort the triangles 4 take each triangle in sorted order , project onto a 2d pixmap , draw and color the triangle . </s>  <s> take the edge of the triangle that is along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge colored with a special edge color it is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem . </s>  <s> the idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface . </s>  <s> the net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface . </s>  <s> the reasons for this are fairly complicated . </s>  <s> they involve both

the server with information about the user s actions which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users . </s>  <s> the client is designed to be generic in other words you don t need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world . </s>  <s> this means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it . </s>  <s> the adaptations , as will be explained in a moment , occur in the servers . </s>  <s> this release of the client software supports the following functionality o hierarchical objects with associated

just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software . </s>  <s> your callback will be activated when a collision occurs . </s>  <s> this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose . </s>  <s> the following is all you need to make a world server

<s> from kenneth sloan removing distortion from bitmapped drawings ? </s>  <s> in article earl boebert writes let s say you have a scanned image of a line drawing in this case a boat , but it could be anything . </s>  <s> on the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x , y positions are known . </s>  <s> now you digitize the drawing manually in this case , using yaron danon s excellent digitize program . </s>  <s> that is , you use a program which converts cursor positions to x , y and saves those values when you click the mouse . </s>  <s> upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values . </s>  <s> this is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper , errors introduced in the printing process , scanner errors and what have you . </s>  <s> the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing , so global adjustments such as stretching contracting uniformly over x or y , or rotating the whole drawing , are not satisfactory . </s>  <s> so the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion ? </s>  <s> in particular , if I have three sets of points reference x , y the known true values distortedreference x , y the same points , with known errors distorteddata x , y other points , with unknown errors what function of reference and distorted could I apply to distorteddata to remove the errors . </s>  <s> I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy 3d surface , solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points . </s>  <s> it helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion . </s>  <s> below is a very short description of the process which we use if you have further questions , feel free to poke me via e mail . </s>  <s> assume locally smooth distortion 0 compute the delaunay triangulation of your x , y points . </s>  <s> this defines the set of neighbors for each point . </s>  <s> if your data are not naturally convex , you may have very long edges on the convex hull . </s>  <s> consider deleting these edges . </s>  <s> 1 now , there are two goals a move the distorteddata x , y to the reference x , y b keep the length e as measured from the current x , y s as close as possible to the digitizedlength e as measured using the digitized x , y s . </s>  <s> 2 for every point , compute a displacement based on a and b . </s>  <s> for example a for x , y points for which you know the reference x , y , you can move alpha 0 reference x , y current x , y . </s>  <s> this will slowly move the distortedreference x , y towards the reference x , y . </s>  <s> b for all other points , examine the current length of each edge . </s>  <s> for each edge , compute a displacement which would make that edge the correct length where correct is the digitizedlength . </s>  <s> take the vector sum of these edge displacements , and move the point alpha 1 sumofedgedisplacements . </s>  <s> this will keep the triangulated mesh consistent with your digitized mesh . </s>  <s> 3 iterate 2 until you are happy for example , no point moves very much . </s>  <s> alpha 0 and alpha 1 need to be determined by experimentation . </s>  <s> consider how much you believe the reference x , y I . </s>  <s> e . </s>  <s> , do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the references , or do you want to balance some error in matching the reference against changes in length of the edges . </s>  <s> warning there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed essentially , you can t allow the convex hull to change , and you can t allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles . </s>  <s> both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points , or by periodically re triangulating the points using the current positions but still calculating digitizedlength from the original positions . </s>  <s> when we first did this , the triangulation time was prohibitive , so we only did it once . </s>  <s> if I were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years , I might go back and re triangulate on every iteration . </s>  <s> if you have more compute power than you know what to do with , you might consider having every point interact with every other point ... but first read up on linear solutions to the n body problem . </s>  <s> there are lots of papers in the

had been using only had 18 frames in it it was a version of the very first movie I created with the compact video compressor . </s>  <s> I decided something a little longer would give closer to real world results for better or for worse . </s>  <s> I pulled out a copy of 2001 a space odyssey that I had recorded off tv a while back . </s>  <s> about fifteen minutes into the movie , there s a sequence where the earth shuttle is approaching the space station . </s>  <s> specifically , I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds duration , zooming in on the rotating space station . </s>  <s> I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames . </s>  <s> to increase the differences between frames , I digitized it at only 5 frames per second , to give a total of 171 frames . </s>  <s> I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384 288 pixels with the spigot card in my centris 650 quarter size resolution from a pal source . </s>  <s> I then imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor , keeping the 5 fps frame rate . </s>  <s> I created two versions of the movie one scaled to 320 240 resolution , the other at 160 120 resolution . </s>  <s> I used the default 2.00 quality setting in premiere 2.0 . </s>  <s> 1 , and specified a key frame every ten frames . </s>  <s> I then ran the 320 240 movie through the same raw speed test program I used for the results I d been reporting earlier . </s>  <s> result a playback rate of over 45 frames per second . </s>  <s> that s right , I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie . </s>  <s> just for fun , I copied the 320 240 movie to my external hard disk a quantum lp105s , and ran it from there . </s>  <s> this time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second . </s>  <s> obviously the 230mb internal hard disk also a quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback . </s>  <s> I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors , and tried playing back the 160 120 movie scaled to 320 240 size . </s>  <s> this time the playback speed was over 60 fps . </s>  <s> clearly , the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime 1.0 in action , not 1.5 . </s>  <s> I d try my tests with quicktime 1.0 , but I don t think it s entirely compatible with my centris and system 7.1 ... unscaled , the playback rate for the 160 120 movie was over 100 fps . </s>  <s> the other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320 240 movie with preferred playback rates greater than 1.0 , and seeing how well they played from within movieplayer ie with quicktime s normal synchronized playback . </s>  <s> a preferred rate of 9.0 45 fps didn t work too well the playback was very jerky . </s>  <s> compare this with the raw speed test , which achieved 45 fps with ease . </s>  <s> I can t believe that quicktime s synchronization code would add this much overhead I think the slowdown was coming from the mac system s task switching . </s>  <s> a preferred rate of 7.0 35 fps seemed to work fine I couldn t see any evidence of stutter . </s>  <s> at 8.0 40 fps I think I could see slight stutter , but with four key frames every second , it was hard to tell . </s>  <s> I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames , to make the stutter more noticeable . </s>  <s> of course , this will also improve the compression slightly , which should speed up the playback performance even more ... lawrence d oliveiro

<s> jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group , the original name of the committee that wrote the standard . </s>  <s> jpeg is designed for compressing either full color or gray scale digital images of natural , real world scenes . </s>  <s> it does not work so well on non realistic images , such as cartoons or line drawings . </s>  <s> jpeg does not handle black and white 1 bit per pixel images , nor does it handle motion picture compression . </s>  <s> standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees , named jbig and mpeg respectively . </s>  <s> jpeg is lossy , meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn t quite identical to what you originally put in . </s>  <s> the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye , notably the fact that small color details aren t perceived as well as small details of light and dark . </s>  <s> thus , jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans . </s>  <s> if you plan to machine analyze your images , the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you , even if they are invisible to the eye . </s>  <s> a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters . </s>  <s> this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality . </s>  <s> you can make extremely small files if you don t mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives , making thumbnail views or icons , etc . </s>  <s> etc . </s>  <s> conversely , if you aren t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting , you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied , and accept lesser compression . </s>  <s> 2 why use jpeg ? </s>  <s> there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller , and to store 24 bit per pixel color data instead of 8 bit per pixel data . </s>  <s> making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images . </s>  <s> being able to compress a 2 mbyte full color file down to 100 kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time ! </s>  <s> if you are comparing gif and jpeg , the size ratio is more like four to one . </s>  <s> more details below . </s>  <s> if your viewing software doesn t support jpeg directly , you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images . </s>  <s> even with a jpeg capable viewer , it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif , for instance . </s>  <s> thus , using jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply . </s>  <s> it s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved , the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file . </s>  <s> I ll let you do the arithmetic yourself . </s>  <s> the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information 24 bits pixel 16 million colors instead of 8 or less 256 or fewer colors . </s>  <s> if you have only 8 bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you . </s>  <s> within a couple of years , though , 8 bit gif will look as obsolete as black and white macpaint format does today . </s>  <s> furthermore , for reasons detailed in section 7 , jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware . </s>  <s> hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard . </s>  <s> 3 when should I use jpeg , and when should I stick with gif ? </s>  <s> jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images , gif is superior in image quality , file size , or both . </s>  <s> one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to . </s>  <s> as a rule of thumb , jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or gray scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material . </s>  <s> jpeg is superior even if you don t have 24 bit display hardware , and it is a lot superior if you do . </s>  <s> see section 7 for details . </s>  <s> gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors , such as cartoons and line drawings . </s>  <s> in particular , large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif . </s>  <s> jpeg can t squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects . </s>  <s> this sort of image is best kept in gif form . </s>  <s> in particular , single color borders are quite cheap in gif files , but they should be avoided in jpeg files . </s>  <s> jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure black pixels adjacent to a row of pure white pixels , for example . </s>  <s> sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting . </s>  <s> again , this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs , but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders , overlaid text , etc . </s>  <s> the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that s only a few pixels high . </s>  <s> if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text , don t jpeg it . </s>  <s> computer drawn images ray traced scenes , for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity . </s>  <s> the more complex and subtly rendered the image , the more likely that jpeg will do well on it . </s>  <s> the same goes for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such . </s>  <s> plain black and white two level images should never be converted to jpeg . </s>  <s> you need at least about 16 gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale images . </s>  <s> it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images of up to 256 levels , while jpeg is not . </s>  <s> if you have an existing library of gif images , you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg . </s>  <s> you will lose a little image quality if you do . </s>  <s> section 7 , which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif , only applies if both formats start from a full color original . </s>  <s> if you start from a gif , you ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse . </s>  <s> however , the disk space savings may justify converting anyway . </s>  <s> this is a decision you ll have to make for yourself . </s>  <s> if you do convert a gif library to jpeg , see section 14 for hints . </s>  <s> be prepared to leave some images in gif format , since some gifs will not convert well . </s>  <s> 4 how well does jpeg compress images ? </s>  <s> pretty darn well . </s>  <s> here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy , a 727x525 full color image of a ship in a harbor . </s>  <s> the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section 6b . </s>  <s> file size in bytes comments ship.ppm 1145040 original file in ppm format no compression 24 bits or 3 bytes per pixel , plus a few bytes overhead ship.ppm . </s>  <s> z 963829 ppm file passed through unix compress compress doesn t accomplish a lot , you ll note . </s>  <s> other text oriented compressors give similar results . </s>  <s> ship.gif 240438 converted to gif with ppmquant fs 256 ppmtogif most of the savings is the result of losing color info gif saves 8 bits pixel , not 24 . </s>  <s> see sec . </s>  <s> 7 . </s>  <s> ship . </s>  <s> jpg 95 155622 cjpeg q 95 highest useful quality setting this is indistinguishable from the 24 bit original , at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs . </s>  <s> ship . </s>  <s> jpg 75 58009 cjpeg q 75 default setting you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original , even with both on screen at once . </s>  <s> ship . </s>  <s> jpg 50 38406 cjpeg q 50 this has slight defects if you know what to look for , you could tell it s been jpeged without seeing the original . </s>  <s> still as good image quality as many recent postings in usenet pictures groups . </s>  <s> ship . </s>  <s> jpg 25 25192 cjpeg q 25 jpeg s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some . </s>  <s> still , I ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this . </s>  <s> ship . </s>  <s> jpg 5o 6587 cjpeg q 5 optimize optimize cuts table overhead blocky , but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes . </s>  <s> note that this file is tiny the compression ratio from the original is 173 1 ! </s>  <s> in this case jpeg can make a file that s a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q 75 file is every bit as good as the gif , better if you have a full color display . </s>  <s> this seems to be a typical ratio for real world scenes . </s>  <s> 5 what are good quality settings for jpeg ? </s>  <s> most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs . </s>  <s> image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting . </s>  <s> there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings . </s>  <s> quality 95 does not mean keep 95 of the information , as some have claimed . </s>  <s> the quality scale is purely arbitrary it s not a percentage of anything . </s>  <s> the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original . </s>  <s> this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another , but here are some rules of thumb . </s>  <s> the default quality setting q 75 is very often the best choice . </s>  <s> this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image . </s>  <s> try q 75 first if you see defects , then go up . </s>  <s> except for experimental purposes , never go above q 95 saying q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as q 95 , but of hardly any better quality . </s>  <s> if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with , you might be able to go down to q 50 without objectionable degradation . </s>  <s> on the other hand , you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation . </s>  <s> the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg . </s>  <s> the default q 75 is about right for compressing 24 bit images , but q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting gifs see section 14 for more info . </s>  <s> if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects , a q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right . </s>  <s> q 2 or so may be amusing as op art . </s>  <s> note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section 6b , and to many programs based on it . </s>  <s> other jpeg implementations , such as image alchemy , may use a completely different quality scale . </s>  <s> some programs don t even provide a numeric scale , just high medium low style choices . </s>  <s> 6 where can I get jpeg software ? </s>  <s> most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp . </s>  <s> if you don t know how to use ftp , see the faq article how to find sources . </s>  <s> if you don t have direct access to ftp , read about ftpmail servers in the same article . </s>  <s> that article appears regularly in news.answers , or you can get it by sending e mail to with send usenet news.answers finding sources in the body . </s>  <s> the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful it s usenet

you don t see what you want for your machine , check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list . </s>  <s> note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too . </s>  <s> x windows xv shareware , 25 is an excellent viewer for jpeg , gif , and many other image formats . </s>  <s> it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations . </s>  <s> it s available for ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu 18.24 . </s>  <s> 0.12 , file contrib xv 3.00.tar . </s>  <s> z . </s>  <s> version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24 bit displays and many other improvements however , it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking . </s>  <s> if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge , stick with version 2.21 , also available from export . </s>  <s> note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24 bit display you ll get only 8 bit color , nor for converting 24 bit images to jpeg . </s>  <s> but 2.21 works fine for converting gif and other 8 bit images to jpeg . </s>  <s> caution there is a glitch in version 2.21 be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file , or the file will be blurry . </s>  <s> another good choice for x windows is john cristy s free imagemagick package , also available from

correctly for colormapped displays , it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software . </s>  <s> both of the above are large , complex packages . </s>  <s> if you just want a simple image viewer , try xloadimage or xli . </s>  <s> xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release , 3.03 . </s>  <s> xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib xloadimage 3.03.tar . </s>  <s> z . </s>  <s> xli is a variant version of xloadimage , said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original . </s>  <s> the current xli

full color 24 bit per pixel display hardware . </s>  <s> typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel , so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time . </s>  <s> to display a full color image , the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors . </s>  <s> this process is called color quantization . </s>  <s> this is something of a misnomer , color selection would be a better term . </s>  <s> we re stuck with the standard usage though . </s>  <s> clearly , color quantization is a lossy process . </s>  <s> it turns out that for most images , the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings . </s>  <s> since jpeg is a full color format , converting a color jpeg image for display on 8 bit or less hardware requires color quantization . </s>  <s> this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a 256 or less color gif into jpeg , what comes out of the decompressor is not 256 colors , but thousands of colors . </s>  <s> this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently , so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors . </s>  <s> each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors . </s>  <s> therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display , regardless of the image source . </s>  <s> the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output . </s>  <s> incidentally , because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image . </s>  <s> even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values , different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences . </s>  <s> I occasionally see posted images described as 256 color jpeg . </s>  <s> this tells me that the poster a hasn t read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif . </s>  <s> jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale just like photographs , but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg . </s>  <s> on the other hand , a gif image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors . </s>  <s> a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette , and the format doesn t allow more than 256 palette entries . </s>  <s> for purposes of usenet picture distribution , gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization , so recipients don t have to . </s>  <s> this is also the disadvantage of gif you re stuck with the sender s quantization . </s>  <s> if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display , you have to re quantize , resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image . </s>  <s> furthermore , if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm , you re out of luck . </s>  <s> for this reason , jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware . </s>  <s> jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware . </s>  <s> furthermore , you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area , or purchase better display hardware , to get a better view of jpeg images you already have . </s>  <s> with a gif , you re stuck forevermore with what was sent . </s>  <s> it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines . </s>  <s> if you view a 256 color gif on a 16 color ega display , for example , you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to . </s>  <s> this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif , one to display it , but often it s also due to sloppiness . </s>  <s> jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all , and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed . </s>  <s> thus , jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones ! </s>  <s> finally , an ever growing number of people have better than 8 bit display hardware already 15 bit hi color pc displays , true 24 bit displays on workstations and macintoshes , etc . </s>  <s> for these people , gif is already obsolete , as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display . </s>  <s> jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively . </s>  <s> thus , jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion . </s>  <s> 8 how does jpeg work ? </s>  <s> the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling , discrete cosine transforms , coefficient quantization , and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding . </s>  <s> this article s

jpeg ? </s>  <s> there s a great deal of confusion on this subject . </s>  <s> the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm , I . </s>  <s> e . </s>  <s> , one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input . </s>  <s> however , this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular , lossy jpeg algorithm , and it offers much less compression . </s>  <s> at present , very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist , and all of them are commercial . </s>  <s> saying q 100 to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image . </s>  <s> what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step . </s>  <s> there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step . </s>  <s> with the v4 free jpeg code , you can also say sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling . </s>  <s> keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file . </s>  <s> even with both quantization and subsampling turned off , the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless , because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations . </s>  <s> the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye , but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image . </s>  <s> at this minimum loss setting , regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24 bit per pixel image . </s>  <s> true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression , but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy . </s>  <s> if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel per color component , you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard . </s>  <s> this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images . </s>  <s> jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with 6 or more bits per pixel furthermore , jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end , while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents . </s>  <s> 10 why all the argument about file formats ? </s>  <s> strictly speaking , jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format . </s>  <s> the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations . </s>  <s> since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format , this leaves us with a problem . </s>  <s> in the absence of official standards , a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing , and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s . </s>  <s> the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems . </s>  <s> they have defined two jpeg based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format , a low end format that transports pixels and not much else . </s>  <s> tiff jpeg , aka tiff 6.0 , an extension of the aldus tiff format . </s>  <s> tiff is a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image , and a lot more besides . </s>  <s> tiff is a lot more complex than jfif , and may well prove less transportable , because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff . </s>  <s> it s not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation . </s>  <s> both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards . </s>  <s> I believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings . </s>  <s> jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted , and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details . </s>  <s> even when tiff jpeg is well defined , the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable . </s>  <s> a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh . </s>  <s> quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure . </s>  <s> conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward , and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section 6a . </s>  <s> if you have an editor that handles binary files , you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section 11 for details . </s>  <s> another particular case is handmade software s programs gif 2jpg jpg 2gif and image alchemy . </s>  <s> these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format . </s>  <s> by default , though , they write a proprietary format developed by hsi . </s>  <s> this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings . </s>  <s> use the j switch to get jfif output . </s>  <s> this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default . </s>  <s> you still should be careful not to post hsi format files , unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms . </s>  <s> 11 how do I recognize which file format I have , and what do I do about it ? </s>  <s> if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read , it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format . </s>  <s> you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file 1 . </s>  <s> a jfif standard file will start with the characters hex ff d8 ff e0 , followed by two variable bytes often hex 00 10 , followed by jfif . </s>  <s> 2 . </s>  <s> if you see ff d8 at the start , but not the rest of it , you may have a raw jpeg file . </s>  <s> this is probably decodable as is by jfif software it s worth a try , anyway . </s>  <s> 3 . </s>  <s> hsi files start with hsi 1 . </s>  <s> you re out of luck unless you have hsi software . </s>  <s> portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data , but they won t decompress properly with non hsi programs . </s>  <s> 4 . </s>  <s> a macintosh pict file , if jpeg compressed , will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif . </s>  <s> strip off everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it . </s>  <s> 5 . </s>  <s> anything else it s a proprietary format , or not jpeg at all . </s>  <s> if you are lucky , the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream . </s>  <s> if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d8 , try stripping off everything before that . </s>  <s> in uuencoded usenet postings , the characteristic jfif pattern is begin line m cx ... whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with begin line m I ... if you learn to check for the former , you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files . </s>  <s> 12 what about arithmetic coding ? </s>  <s> the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed . </s>  <s> the choice has no impact on image quality , but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file . </s>  <s> on typical images , arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman coding . </s>  <s> all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding . </s>  <s> unfortunately , the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm , at t , and mitsubishi . </s>  <s> thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies . </s>  <s> the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm , but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best . </s>  <s> at least in the short run , I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles . </s>  <s> in particular , arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet . </s>  <s> there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future . </s>  <s> stay tuned for further details . </s>  <s> 13 does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression ? </s>  <s> it would be nice if , having compressed an image with jpeg , you could decompress it , manipulate it crop off a border , say , and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially . </s>  <s> unfortunately this is not the case . </s>  <s> in general , recompressing an altered image loses more information , though usually not as much as was lost the first time around . </s>  <s> the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss , I . </s>  <s> e . </s>  <s> , you get an identical jpeg file . </s>  <s> even this is not true at least , not with the current free jpeg software . </s>  <s> it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error . </s>  <s> if you repeatedly compress and decompress , the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output . </s>  <s> it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change . </s>  <s> one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited , but I am not optimistic about it . </s>  <s> in any case , the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg , at the original quality setting , would introduce no further loss . </s>  <s> even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation . </s>  <s> if you re wondering why , it s because the pixel block boundaries move . </s>  <s> if you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels , you might be safe , but that s a mighty limited capability ! </s>  <s> the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images , but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps . </s>  <s> use a lossless format ppm , rle , tiff , etc while working on the image , then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away . </s>  <s> aside from avoiding degradation , you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way . </s>  <s> 14 what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg ? </s>  <s> as stated earlier , you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg . </s>  <s> if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from , it s far better to make a jpeg from that . </s>  <s> but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from , here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality . </s>  <s> the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg , to make sure you are happy with it , before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary . </s>  <s> some gifs may be better left as gifs , as explained in section 3 in particular , cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well . </s>  <s> you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif . </s>  <s> so check the sizes too . </s>  <s> experience to date suggests that large , high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg . </s>  <s> they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings , and they convert to jpeg with least degradation . </s>  <s> don t waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes . </s>  <s> also , don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals . </s>  <s> to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be I . </s>  <s> e . </s>  <s> , shoot for 1 2 or 1 3 rd the size of the gif file , not 1 4 th as suggested in earlier comparisons . </s>  <s> many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image . </s>  <s> while useless , this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files . </s>  <s> it is not free in jpeg files , and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges . </s>  <s> do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging . </s>  <s> if you are on an x windows system , xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this . </s>  <s> cjpeg s default q setting of 75 is appropriate for full color input , but for gif inputs , q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation . </s>  <s> if you apply smoothing as suggested below , the higher q setting may not be necessary . </s>  <s> color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store . </s>  <s> if you enlarge the image , you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value . </s>  <s> the trouble with dithering is that , to jpeg , it looks like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg can t compress noise very well . </s>  <s> the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it . </s>  <s> to get around this , you want to smooth the gif image before compression . </s>  <s> smoothing averages together nearby pixels , thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway , and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble . </s>  <s> appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor , thus further reducing the size of the compressed file , while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing . </s>  <s> with the v4 free jpeg software or products based on it , a simple smoothing capability is built in . </s>  <s> try smooth 10 or so when converting gifs . </s>  <s> values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high quality gifs . </s>  <s> heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors . </s>  <s> if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement , then strong smoothing is definitely called for . </s>  <s> too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image , which you don t want . </s>  <s> if you are an image processing wizard , you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program , such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package . </s>  <s> however , cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol ... the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 85 smooth 10 is probably a good starting point for converting gifs . </s>  <s> but if you really care about the image , you ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings . </s>  <s> for more
