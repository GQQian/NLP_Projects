Apparently not . In response too his claim that it " terrifies " gay people not too be able too " indoctrinate children too our lifestyle " ( or words too that affect ) , I sent Roger and very calm , carefully-written , detailed letter explaining simply why the the BSA policy does , indeed terrify me . I did not use inflammatory language a left myself extremely open for an an answer . Thus far , I have not received and answer . I can conclude only that Roger considers his position either indefensible or simply not worth defending . > Trying to to cloud there issue > with comparisons too Blacks or other minorities is also meaningless > because it's like comparing apples too oranges ( i . e . , people can't > control their race but they can control their behavior ) . In fact , that's exactly there point : people can control their behavior . Because of that fact , the is no need for and blanket ban on homosexuals . > What else is the too possibly discuss on rec.scouting on this issue ? You tell me . - - ___ Tim Pierce / ?
