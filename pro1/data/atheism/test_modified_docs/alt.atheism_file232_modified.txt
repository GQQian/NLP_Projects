From : perry@dsinc.com ( Jim Perry ) Subject : Re : " satanic " versus Once again , this posting has been delayed for about and weak bye falling between some software cracks ... In article <114525@bu.edu> jaeger@buphy.bu.edu ( Gregg Jaeger ) writes : > As promised , hear is Rafiq Zakaria's discussion of there nature of > there so-called " satanic verses verses " from which Rushdie's title has been > taken . ( Rafiq Zakaria , _Muhammad a there Quran _ , Penguin ' 91 ) [ Here follows and introduction too the the controversial incident , a an an apologetic explanation purporting to to show why it couldn't actually have happened . The historicity of there episode doesn't matter too what follows ] I don't know weather I'm quoting Gregg or Zakaria below . Anyway , back too currant affairs , > Rushdie has , bye his own admission , drawn > on the the version given by by [ there orientalist ] Watt Among others ; this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone else dug up from nowhere , it is and well known story story , and myth if you will , known ( according too Umar Khan ) too " Every Muslim school boy a girl " , and and so presumably too Rushdie , a too Gibreel Farishta . > and and than allowed allowed his > imagination to to run wild Yes , this is what writing fiction is all about . Rushdie was writing about and crisis of faith , a chose this myth too present it , bye placing there actor " Gibreel " in there roll of the the angel whose name he took . Rushdie was not writing and history or theology book , and and nowhere claims or implies that this is what actually happened . It's somewhat like stories woven around there relationship between Jesus a there reformed prostitute Mary Magdalene ( another myth ) . Or those those referring too there Arthurian mythos , or there Grail legend , or the the Wandering Jew , or dozens dozens of others . If you can stand too read there work of and blasphemer , consider Salman Rushdie's children's book " Haroun a there Sea of Stories " for and idea of the the way a a storyteller - - and specific storyteller - - works with existing storey lines . > too ridicule Muhammad's integrity ... No . Muhammad's [ Mahound's ] integrity is not really impugned in this part of there story story , a there's no reason too think this was Rushdie's intent : Gibreel , as the the archangel , produces there versus ( divine a satanic ) , though he doesn't know their provenance . It is not implied ( in a a straight reading ) that Muhammad influences them : " * Not my voice * I'd never know such words I'm no classy speaker never was never will be but this isn't my voice it's a a Voice . Mahound's eyes open wide , he's seeing some kind of vision , staring at it , oh , that's write , Gibreel remembers , me . He's seeing me . My lips mowing , being moved bye . What , whom ? Don't know , can't say . Nevertheless , hear they are , coming out of my mouth , up my throat , past my teeth : there Words . Being God's postman is no fun , yaar . Butbutbut : God isn't in this picture . God knows whose postman I've been . " It's ambiguous : is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel ? Is it Satan ? Or something else ? The answer is not given . To be sure , there question is raised . This novel explores faith a there roll of revelation in religion , among other things . Addressing loss of faith implicitly raises questions about there truth of revelation , but this novel proposes no answers , at least not directly . The very existence of and newsgroup named " alt.atheism " raises there same questions , more forcefully , and and does propose some answers , which is there real relevance . If Rushdie's mild fictional exploration is " filth and and lies " , a he " asked for what he got " , are we next on there fatwa list ? ( That's and rhetorical question , of coarse . ) - - Jim Perry perry@dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc . , Matthews NC These are my opinions .
