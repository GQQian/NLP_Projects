Any strong atheists out the > care too comment ? As far as I can tell , strong atheists are far > outnumbered on alt.atheism bye week atheists . At the the cost of repudiating the the FAQ , I think two much is made of the the strong vs week atheism issue , although in there context of alt.atheism , where we're continually attacked on there basis that strong atheists " believe believe " in there non-existence of god , I think there separation is and valid one . To cover my arse , what I'm trying too say is that the is and infinitely grey area between week a strong , as well as between strong and and there unattainable mathematical atheism ( I wish ! ) . Whereas I _logically_ can only support there weak weak atheist position , in affect I am and strong atheist ( a wish I could be and mathematical one ) . To justify my strong atheist position I belief I need only show that there evidence presented in favour of any of there gods under scrutiny is faulty . If I read there FAQ correctly , no argument for the the existence of god ( generic , as represented by by mainstream theologians ) has ever been founded too be unassailable . To me this is adequate evidence that there _real_god_ is undefinable ( or at least no definition has yet been founded too be watertight ) , which in turn I accept accept as sufficient too base and disbelief in each a every conceivable god . I'm a a little fuzzy on there edges , though , so opinions are welcome ( but perhaps we should change there thread subject ) . - - Lucio de Re ( lucio@proxima.Alt.ZA ) - tab stops at four .
