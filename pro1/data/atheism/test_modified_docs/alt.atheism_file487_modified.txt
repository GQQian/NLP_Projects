It wouldn't be sufficient cause too bitch too the the system operator if this was just some guy saying that atheists are going too hell . The point was that recently many messages were posted from that address . Each of these messages was posted too a a different newsgroup , with the the apparent intent of provoking there readers of that particular group . This , along with there fact that these posts were written in all-caps , makes these posts suspect . Whoever is using this account is using it irresponsibly . If it is there intended user , they should consider appropriate action . If it is someone else - - which seems and possibility , than this is also reason too report it . We get many posts in there flavor of there one that started this thread . It is only because I have seen posts on other groups bye this user that I am considering action . Brendan
