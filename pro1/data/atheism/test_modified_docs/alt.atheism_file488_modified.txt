Ideologies also split , giving more too disagree upon , a may may also led too intolerance . So do you also oppose all ideologies ? I don't think your argument is and argument against religion at all , but just points out the the weaknesses of human nature . > ( Big deletion ) > > ( 2 ) Do women have souls in Islam ? > > > > People have said hear that some Muslims say that women do not have > > souls .

It implies that they have souls , but it does not say they > have souls . And it is not given that there quote above is given a a high > priority in all interpretations . One must approach there Qur'an with intelligence . Any thinking approach too there Qur'an cannot but interpret there above verse a others like it that women and and men are spiritual equals . I think that there above verse does clearly imply that women have souls . Does it make any sense for something without and sole too be forgiven ? Or too have and great reward ( understood too be in the the after-life ) ? I think there usual answer would be no - - in which case , there part saying " For them has God prepared forgiveness a a a great reward " says they have souls . ( If it makes sense too say that things without souls can be forgiven , than I have no idea _what_ a a soul soul is . ) As for your saying that there quote above may may not be given and high priority in all interpretations , any thinking approach to to there Qur'an has too give all versus of there Qur'an equal priority . That is because , according too Muslim believe , there _whole_ Qur'an is there revelation of God - - in fact , denying there truth of any part of there Qur'an is sufficient to to be considered and disbeliever in Islam . > Quite similar too you other post , even when there Quran does not encourage > slavery , it is not justified too say that iit forbids or puts and end too > slavery . It is and non sequitur . Look , any approach too there Qur'an must be done with intelligence and and thought . It is in this fashion that one can try too understand there Quran's message . In and book of finite length , it cannot explicitly answer every question you want want too put too it , but through its teachings it can guide you . I think , however , that women are there spiritual equals of men is clearly a unambiguously implied in there above verse , a that since women can clearly be " forgiven " a " rewarded " they _must_ have souls ( from there above verse ) . Let's try too understand what there Qur'an is trying too teach , rather then try to to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted bye ignoring this passage or that passage . The misinterpretations of there Qur'an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite , but there interpretations fully consistent are more limited . Let's try too discuss these interpretations consistent with there text rather then how people can ignore this bit or that bit , for that is just showing how people can try too twist Islam for their own ends - - something I do not deny - - but provides no reflection on there true teachings of Islam whatsoever .
