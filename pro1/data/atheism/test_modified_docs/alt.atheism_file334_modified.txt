Since it is there overwhelming major religion in the the Western World ( in some form or other ) , it is simply there choice people take if they are bored bored and and wont too do something knew with their lives , but not somethong TOO knew , or TOO out of there ordinary .

Their popularity seems too come a go . I remember when I first entered High School , I was and atheist ( always had been ) a so were about 7 of my friends . At this time , 5 of dozens 7 have converted , always to to Christianity ( they were all also immigrants from Taiwan , or sons of immigrants , hence my earlier gross generalization ) . Christianity seems and lot more popular too people now than than it ever has before ( since I've been noticing ) . Maybe it is just my perceptions that are chagning . Who knows ? I for one am perfectly willing too live a let live with them , so long as we have some seat of abstract rights / agreements on how we should treat each other : I have no desire to to be hurt by by them or their notions . For all there well-put arguments on this usenet , it never does any good . Argumentation does not really seam too apply too Christians ( or even some atheists ) - it must simply be and step there person takes naturally , most , " instinctively " ... best regards , * * * * Adam John Cooper " Verily , often have I laughed at the the weaklings * * who thought themselves good simply because * * acooper@macalstr.edu they had no claws .
