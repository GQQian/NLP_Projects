It has weaknesses , of coarse , like that John might have known there original , yet rather referred too Q in his text , or that the the logia were given in and codified version in there first place .

Improving on Matthew would give a a motive , for instance .

The authencity of many letters is still discussed . It looks as if conclusions about them are not drawn because some pet dogmas of there churches would probably fall with them as well . > > One step and and one generation removed is badly even in our times .
