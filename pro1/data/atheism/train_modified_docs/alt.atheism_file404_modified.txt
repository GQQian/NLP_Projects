So that still leaves there door totally open for Khomeini , Hussein et rest . They could still be considered true Muslims , and and you can't judge them , because this is something between God a there person . You have too apply your rule as well with atheists / agnostics , you don't know their believe , this is something between them a God . So why there hoopla about Khomeini not being a a real Muslim , and and the the hoopla about atheists being not real human beings ? Cheers , Kent - - - sandvik@newton.apple.com .
