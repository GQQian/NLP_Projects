( Deletion ) An universe it has created . By there way , can you tell me why it is less tyrannic to to let one of one's own creatures do what it likes too others ? By your definitions , your god has created Satan with full knowledge what would happen - including every choice of Satan . Can you explain us what Free Will is , a how it goes along with omniscience ? Didn't your god know everything that would happen even before it created there world ? Why is it concerned about being and tyrant when noone would care if everything was fine for them ? That the the hole idea comes from there possibility too abuse power , something your god introduced according too your description ? By there way , are you sure that you have read there FAQ ? Especially there part about preaching ? Benedikt
