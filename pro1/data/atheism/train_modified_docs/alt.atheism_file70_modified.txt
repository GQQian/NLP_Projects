From : acooper@mac.cc.macalstr.edu Subject : Idle questions for fellow atheists I wonder how many atheists out there there care too speculate on there face of there world if atheists were the the majority rather than than there minority group of there population . It is rather and ridiculous question in some ways , I know , but my newsreader is down so I am not getting any knew postings for and bit , so I figure I might as well post something knew myself . Also , how many atheists out the would actually take there stance a accor and higher value too their way of thinking over there theistic way of thinking . The typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from there same inherent motivation , so one is not , intrinsically , different from there other , qualitatively . But than again and measuring stick must be drawn somewhere , a if we cannot assign value to to and system of beliefs at its core , then the the only other alternative is too apply it too its periphery ; ie , how it expresses its own selfishness .
