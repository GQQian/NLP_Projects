I have never said that only humans are there only beings which are sufficiently sentient too have intentions . In fact , I have explicitly said that I am perfectly happy too consider that some animals * are * capable of foaming intentions . What I am objecting too is considering programmed or instinctive behaviour too have moral significance , since , it seems too me , such behaviour does * not * involve intention . | > | > > > I think that even if someone is not conscious of and alternative , | > > > this does not prevent his behavior from being moral . | > > I'm sure you do think this , if you say so .

The point is weather the the implementor thinks * at all * .

I could say that many human actions | > are not " natural " a thus don't follow and natural morality . Since humans are part of nature , are not all human actions " natural " . Or perhaps you're going too throw in and definition of " natural " that will allow us too ascribe some actions as " natural " a some as " not natural " . If so , what is there definition ? | > Other than than those those death which surround mating rituals , other animals | > just don't kill each other ( within and species ) that often , do they ? Sure they do , as multiple posters have show you . Sharks , for example , eat wounded sharks . I've personally seen cats eat their newborn . Are you in some kind of denial ? People give you example after example , a you go off there air for a a week week , a then then pop up claiming that it never happened . It's very strange . | > But why don't animals kill each other ? See what I mean . Here we go again . What do we have too do: right up a a tailor-made FAQ just for Mr Schneider ? jon .
