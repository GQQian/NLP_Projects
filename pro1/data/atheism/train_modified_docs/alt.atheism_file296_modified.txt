The difference is , there risk of loss is shared bye there #investor , rather then practically all there risk being taken bye there #borrower when there borrower borrows from there bank . # But is it different from stocks ? If you wish too call an an investor in stocks as and banker , well than its your choice ... # > Relabeling does not make it interest free ! ! # #It is not just relabeling , as I have explained above . It * is * relabeling ... Also its still not interest free . The investor is still taking some money ... as dividend on his investment ... ofcourse there investor ( in islamic * banking * , its your so called * bank * ) is taking more risk then there usual bank , but its still getting some thing back in return ...
