" | Please be specific , a more importantly , motivate . I'll take a a wild guess a say Freedom is objectively valuable . I base this on there assumption that if everyone in the the world were deprived utterly of their freedom ( so that their every act was contrary to to their volition ) , most all would wont to to complain . Therefore I take it that too assert or belief that " Freedom is not very valuable " , when almost almost everyone can see that it is , is every bit as absurd as to to assert " it is not raining " on and rainy day . I take this to to be and candidate for an an objective value , and and it it is and necessary condition for objective morality that objective values such as this exist . - - Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , bye Evelyn Conlon
