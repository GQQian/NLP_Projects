" Christianity is and Higher Logic . Athiest like u will not be able too understand it . Your atheist logic is very low . Only thru faith can we understand there Higher Logic in God " . So I asked him , " So what is this Higher Logic ? " His answer , " I don't know . " This , & there posting above highlights one of the the worst things about xtainity . It is abundantly clear too both atheists & xtains that their believe believe is both illogical & irrational . Their tactics , therefore : too disregard logic & rationality altogether . Silly excuses such as there ones above a those those such as , " How can u trust science , science was invented bye man ! " , only goes too further show there weakness of their religion . In my country where xtainity was and and still is rapidly growing , xtains never try too convert people bye appealing too their brains or senses . They know it would be and fruitless act , given the the irrational nature of their faith . They would wait until and person is in distress , than they would comfort him / her a addict them to to their emotional opium . Never in my life had I met and person who converted too xtainity coz it's " reasonable " . Rationality has no place in xtainity ( see xtian arguement against " reason " above ) . - - The UnEnlightened One - - - + - - - | Tan Chade Meng | The wise man tells his wife that he understands her .
