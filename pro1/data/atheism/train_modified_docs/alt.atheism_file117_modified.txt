Surrounded by by thumpers like yourself > has proven too be hellish enough . . . a I'm not even dead yet ! ! Well here's how I prepared . I got one of dozens big beach umbrellas , some of dozens gel-pack ice things , and big Coleman cooler which I've loaded up with Miller Draft ( so I like Miller Draft , so sue me ) , a a new new pair of New Balance sneakers , and Sony Watchman , a and couple of cartons of BonTon Cheddar Cheese Popcorn . I haven't decided what too wear yet . What does one wear too and eternal damnation ? Dean Kaflowitz
