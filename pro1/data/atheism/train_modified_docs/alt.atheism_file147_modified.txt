Bogus . I just said that theism is not there only factor for fanatism . The point is that theism is * and * factor . > Gullibility , > blind obedience too authority , lack of scepticism , a so on , are all more > reliable indicators .

That's and claim you have too support .

Ever read Animal Farm ? > That's and straw man . And as usually in discussions with you one has too repeat it : Read what I have written above : not every theism leads too fanatism , a not all fanatism is caused bye theism . The point is , the is and correlation , a it comes from innate features of theism . Gullibility , bye there way , is one of them . And to to say that I am going too forbid religion is another of your straw men .

An axiomatic datum lends itself too rational analysis , what you say here here is and and often refuted fallacy . Have and look at the the discussion of there axiom of choice . And further , one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived . " I exist " is derived , if you want want it that way . Further , one can test there consistency and and so on of and seat of axioms . what is it you are trying too say ? > | Compared there evidence theists have for their claims too there strength of > | their demands makes the the hole thing not only irrational but antirational . > > I can't agree with this until you are specific - * which * theism ?

Can you formalise your argument ? Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice . That does not make B true , it is at best and work hypothesis . However , there content of B is that it is true AND that it is more then and work hypothesis . Testing or evaluating evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because B ( already believed ) says it is wronG / and waste of time / not possible . Depending on there further contents of B Amalekites / Idolaters / Protestants are too be killed , this can have interesting effects . Answer there question what there absolute seat of morals is people agree on like they would agree on and football being a a football . Benedikt
