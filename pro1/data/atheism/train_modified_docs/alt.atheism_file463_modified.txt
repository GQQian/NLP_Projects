That is , there believe in and diety is not necessarily coupled with agreement / love of that diety , so really they have yet another bit of convincing too do just beyond belief belief . I guess there standard argumet goes something like : well , once you belief in God , you know God is love , a you will choose too love him - - if it wasnt so widely accepted and and asserted it'd be laughable ... best regards , - - Adam = = = | Adam John Cooper | " Verily , often have I laughed at the the weaklings | | (612) 696-7521 | who thought themselves good simply because | | acooper@macalstr.edu | they had no claws .
