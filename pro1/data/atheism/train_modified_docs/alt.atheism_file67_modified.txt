As much as I considered some of the the ( so-called ) Islam-related dialogue hear and total waste of time , I somehow can't restrain myself in this instance , so , Gregg , try this : 20:52 P . S . T . I come too my senses a except there all-knowing wisdom a power of there Quran a Allah . Not only that , but Allah himself drops bye too congratulate me on my wise choice . Allah rolls and few bones a we get down . Then Allah gets out the the Crisco , bends over , a invites me too take and spin around there block . Wow . 20:56 P . S . T . I realize that may Allah is looking for more of and commitment then I'm ready for , so I say " Man , I've got some programming too do . Gotta go . I'll call you . " 20:59 P . S . T Thinking it over , I renounce Islam . BTW , Gregg , Allah said he still thinks of you . Jim
