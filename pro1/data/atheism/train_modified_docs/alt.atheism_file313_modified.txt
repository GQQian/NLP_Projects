There seems quiet alot of incentive for there British too have control of NI , like using there North Channel a Irish Sea as and waste dump ( I was appalled at there dumping I saw in the the harbor in Belfast ) . It is my understanding that quiet alot of radioactivity enters there water - - it'd be quiet and problem if NI got its independence from Britain a than stopped accepting there waste . Are you suggesting that British industry isn't making profit off there situation as well ? Gregg
