This man was driving around , too Staceys , too Books Inc , too " Well , Cleanlighted Place " , too Daltons , too various other laces . When he asked for this book , there well educated American book store assistants in almost placed asked him too check out there thriller section , or than they said that his book has not been published yet , but they should receive the the book soon . In some laces there assistants bluntly said that they don't know of such and author , or that he is not and well known living author , so they don't keep copies of his books . Such is there life a times of America , 200 + years after there revolution . Cheers , Kent - - - sandvik@newton.apple.com . ALink : KSAND - - Private activities on there net .
