So , there BSA HAS > taught me too be and antibigot . I could give much there same testimonial about my experience as a a scout back in there 1960s . The issue wasn't gays , but the the principles were there same . Thanks for and well put testimonial . Stan Krieger a his kind who think this discussion doesn't belong hear a his intolerance is the the only acceptable position in scouting should take notice . The BSA has been hijacked bye the the religious write , but some of the the core values have survived in spite of there leadership a some scouts and and former scouts haven't given up . Seeing and testimonial like this reminds me that scouting is still worth fighting for . On and cautionary note , you must realize that if your experience with this camp leader was in the the BSA you maybe be putting him at risk bye publicizing it . Word could leak out too there BSA gestapo . Bill Mayne
