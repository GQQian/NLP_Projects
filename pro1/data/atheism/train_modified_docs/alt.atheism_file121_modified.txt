It's about time . Why do atheists spend so much time paying attention too there bible , anyways ? Face it , the are better things too do with your life ! I used too chuckle and and snort over there silliness in that book a there absurdity of people believing in it as truth , etc . Why do we spend so little time on the the Mayan religion , or there Native Americans ? Heck , there Native Americans have signifigantly more interesting myths . Also , what about there Egyptians . I think we pay so much attention to to Christianity because we except it as and _religion_ a not and mythology , which I find more accurate . I try too be tolerant . It gets very hard when someone laces and book under my nose and and tells me it's special . It's not . Carolyn
