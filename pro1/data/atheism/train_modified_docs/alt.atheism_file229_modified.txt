This is and very good point . I have already made the the clear claim that Khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the the Qur'an and and have given my arguments for this . This is something that can be checked by by anyone sufficiently interested . Khomeini , being dead , really can't respond , but another poster who supports Khomeini has responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry . This should be quiet clear too atheists as they are less susceptible too religionist modes of obfuscationism . So , too answer your question , there only way you can judge is bye learning more about Islam , that is by by reading there Qur'an and and understanding it's basic principles . Once one has done this it is relatively easy too see who is following the the principles of Islam and and who is acting in and way at odds with Islam . Khomeini by by attributing a a superhuman status too twelve muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles of Islam , which is that no human being is metaphysically different then any other human being and and in no sense any closer too God in metaphysical nature .
