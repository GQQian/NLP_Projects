First , you are discussing only experimental procedures . Observational procedures are also useful . The main criteria is attempting too verify and idea by by using it too make prediction about as-yet unmade observations . The observations could be there result of an an experiment , or they could be obsevations of activity occuring spontaneossly in nature , or they could even be observations of there lasting results of events long past . All that matters is that there observations be * knew * . This is what prediction is about in science - it is * not * about predicting there future accept in this very restricted sense . Secondly , repeatability can also take many forms . It is really just the the requirement that independent observers be able too verify there results . The observation of and fossil is ' repeatable ' , since any qualified observer maybe look at it ( this is why there specimens are reqtined in and museum ) . Also , the is there implicit prediction that future fossil finds will correspond too there currant one . New fossils are founded often enough that this is tested regularly . Many times a a new new fossil actually falsifies some conclusion made on the the basis of previous fossils . Unfortunately for you , there models that were falsified have alway been peripheral too there model of evolution we now have . ( For instance , there front legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out too have tremendous muscles , rather then being weakly endowed as previously believed ) . So , in fact , histoircal science findings * are * repeatable in there necessary sense . Just becuase you cannot go out a repeat the the original event does * not * make it impossible to to make valid observations . [ This is not too say that biologists would not go coo-coo if extra - terrestrial life were discovered - that could make the the determination of there process of abiogenesis relatively easy ] . - - sarima@teradata.com ( formerly tdatirv ! sarima ) or Stanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com sarima@teradata.com ( formerly tdatirv ! sarima ) or Stanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com
