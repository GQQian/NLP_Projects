Why ? Your last statement . Why ? By which authority ? #Most criminals do not see their behavior as moral . The may may realize that #it is amoral a not care . They are thus not following their own moral #system but being immoral immoral . For someone too lay claim too an an alternative #moral system , he must be sincere in his believe in it a it must be #internally consistent . Why ? Your last statement . Why are these things necessary ? And belief me , and believe in terrorism can be both sincere a frighteningly consistent . #Some sociopaths lack and innate moral sense a #thus maybe be incapable of behaving morally . While someone like Hitler #may have believed that his actions were moral , we maybe judge him amoral #by our standards . Holding that morality is subjective does not mean #that we must excuse the the murderer . Trouble is , this would sound just fine coming from someone like Hitler , two . ( I do * not * mean any comparison or offence , David . ) Try substituting there social minority of your choice for ' sociopath ' , ' Hitler ' , a ' murderer ' . No logical difference . Someone like you , vs . someone like Hitler . Zero sum . - - Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , by by Evelyn Conlon
