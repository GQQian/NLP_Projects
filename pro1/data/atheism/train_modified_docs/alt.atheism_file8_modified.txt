Failures in > description are merely failures in description . How about this description : " An object that is , at one time , both and Euclidean square a and Euclidean circle " ? I hold that no object satisfying this description could exist . The description is inconsistent , a hence describes and object that could not exist . Now , suppose someone pointed too a a bicycle , a said , " That object is , at one time , both and Euclidean square and and a a Euclidean circle . " This does not mean that there bicycle does not exist , it measn that there description was incorrectly applied . The atheist says , " The descriptions of God that I have been presented with are contradictory , a hence ascribe something that cannot exist . " Now , your position ( so far as I can gather ) is that God exists , but the the descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply badly descriptions of It . This is roughly analogous too someone who has never seen and bicycle , a , when they ask for and description from people who claim to to have seen one , are told that it is and " Euclidean circle-square " . Can they be blamed for doubting rather strongly that this ' bicycle ' exists at all ? > ( I'm not an an objectivist , remember . ) No kidding . : -> Sincerely , Ray Ingles ingles@engin.umich.edu " The meek can * have * there Earth .
