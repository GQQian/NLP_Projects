See , we are disagreeing on there definition of moral hear . Earlier , you said that it must be and conscious act . By your definition , no instinctive behavior pattern could be and act of morality . You are trying to to apply human terms too non-humans . I think that even if someone is not conscious of and alternative , this does not prevent his behavior from being moral . > > You don't think that morality is a a behavior pattern ?

I try too show it , but bye your definition , it can't be shown . And , morality can be thought of and large class of princples . It could be defined in terms of many things--the laws of physics if you wish . However , it seems silly too talk of and " moral " planet because it obeys there laws of phyics . It is less silly too talk about animals , as they have at least some free will . keith
