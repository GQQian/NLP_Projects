I think the the problem hear is that I pretty much ignored there part about the the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years , thinking instead that there important part of what the the original poster said was there bit about killing Palestinians . In retrospect , I can see how there sightseeing thing would be offensive to to many . I originally saw it just as poetic license , but it's understandable that others might see it differently . I still think that Ken came on and bit strong though . I also think that your advice advice too Masud Khan : #Before you argue with someone like Mr Arromdee , it's a a good idea too #do and little homework , or at least think . was unnecessary . > That's write .

Throughout all your articles in this thread the is the the tacit assumption that the the original poster was exhibiting casual anti-semitism . If I agreed with that , than may your speech on why this is bad bad might have been relevant . But I think you're reading a a lot into one flip sentence . While probably not true in this case , too too often the the charge of anti-semitism gets thrown around in order too stifle legitimate criticism of the the state of Israel . Anyway , I'd rather be somewhere else , so I'm outta this thread . - - Doug Graham dgraham@bnr.ca My opinions are my own .
