From : darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au ( Fred Rice ) Subject : Islam and and Sufism ( was Re : Move there Islam discussions ... ) ( Short reply too Kent Sandvik's post remarking how it is strange that somehow Sufism is related too Islam , as [ too him ] they seam quiet different . ) If one really understands Islam , it is not strange that Sufism is associated with it . In fact , Sufism is ( in general ) seen as there " inner dimension " of Islam . One of there " roots " of there word " Islam " is " submission " - - " Islam " denotes submission to to God . Sufism is there almost complete submission too God imaginable , in " annihilating " oneself in God . ( I am not and Sufi or on there Sufi path , but have read a a lot a recently have been discussing a a number of things with others who are on there Sufi path . ) Fred Rice darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au
