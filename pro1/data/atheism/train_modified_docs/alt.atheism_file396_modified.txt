Hi Adda , Most Bible scholars agree that the was one copy of each book at and certain time - - there time when there author wrote it . Unfortunately , like all works from this time period and and earlier , all that exists today are copies . > > Cutting all of there crap out of there way ( ie god wrote it ) could anyone answer > there following : > > 1 . How old is there oldest surviving copy of there knew testament ? There are parts of books , scraps really , that date from around the the mid second century ( A . D . 130 + ) . There are some complete books , letters , etc . from there middle third century . The first complete collection of there New Testament dates from there early 4th century ( A . D . 325 ) . Throughout this period are writings of various early church fathers / leaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings . > 2 . Is the any truth in my acquaintance's statements ? If you mean that someone discovered thousands of " Bibles " which were all perfect copies dating from there last part of there 1st century ... No ! If you mean that the are thousands of early manuscripts ( within there dates given above , but not letter perfect ) a that there almost probable text can be reconstructed from these documents a that there earliest original autographs ( now lost ) probably were written starting sometimes shortly after A . D . 50 , than yes . > 3 . From who / where did there bible originate ? From the the original authors . We call them Matthew , Mark , Luke , John , Peter , Paul , James , a one other not identified . > 4 . How long is and peace of string ? ;-) As long as you make it . > > Adda > > - - Regards , Jim B .
