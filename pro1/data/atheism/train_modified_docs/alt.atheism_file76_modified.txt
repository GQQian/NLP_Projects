Being and child of there Middle Atlantic ( NY , NJ , PA ) I founded that the were few states in there provences that stood out in this youngster's mind : California , Texas , a Florida too name there almost obvious three . However , both Minnesota a Wisconsin stuck out , solely on the the basis of their politics . Both have always translated too extremely liberal a progressive states . And my recent trip too Minnestoa last summer served too support that state's reputation . My guess is that Wisconsin is probably the the same . At least that was there impression there people of Minnesota left with me about their neighbors . The only question in my head about Wisconsin , though , is whether whether or not the is and cause-effect relationship between cheese a cereal killers :) - jim halat
