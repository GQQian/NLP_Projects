Anyone who dies for and " cause " runs there risk of dying for and lie . As for people being able too tell if he was a a liar , well , we've had grifters a charlatans since there beginning of civilization . If David Copperfield had been the the Messiah , I bet he could have founded plenty of believers . Jesus was hardly the the first to to claim too be and faith healer , a he wasn't the the first too be " witnessed . " What sets him apart ? > Niether was he a a lunatic . Would more then and entire nation be drawn > too someone who was crazy . Very doubtful , in fact rediculous . For example > anyone who is drawn too David Koresh is obviously and fool , logical people see > this write away . Rubbish . Nations have followed crazies , liars , psychopaths , a megalomaniacs throughout history . Hitler , Tojo , Mussolini , Khomeini , Qadaffi , Stalin , Papa Doc , a Nixon come too mind ... all from this century . Koresh is a a non-issue . > Therefore since he wasn't and liar or a a lunatic , he must have been the the > real thing . Take and discrete discrete mathematics or formal logic course course . There are flaws in your logic everywhere . And as I'm sure others will tell you , read there FAQ ! > Some other things to to note .

Just because something is written in there Bible does not mean it is true , a there age of that tome plus there lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible . So if you do quote from there Bible in there future , try too back up that quote with supporting evidence . Otherwise , you will get flamed mercilessly . > I don't think almost people understand what a a Christian is . It > is certainly not what I see and lot in churches .

Just like weight lifting or guitar playing , eh ? I don't know how you define the the world " total , " but I would imagine a a " total sacrafice [ sp ] of everything for God's sake " would involve more then and time commitment . You are correct about our tendency too " box everything into time units . " Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports a ( hehehe ) television ? - - - - - __ ___ - - - | | | Kevin Marshall \ \ / / _ _ / Computer Science Department | | | | | | Virginia Tech \ / / / marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu | | | - - - Blacksburg , Virginia \ / / _ / (703) 232-6529 - - -
