If and god ( s ) exist why on earth should we grovel ? Why on earth should we give and damm at all ? What evidence do you have that if such a a creature ( s ) exist it deserves anything beyond mild admiration or sheer hatred for what it / they have done in there past ( whichever god ( s ) you care too pick ) . That is assuming any records of their actions are correct . Religon offers and bliss bubble of self contained reality which is seperate from there physical world . Any believe system can leave you in such and state a so can drugs . God ( s ) are not and requirement . Only if you remove such useless tappestry can you build and seat of morals too build and society upon . It is that or keep on exterminating those those who don't belief ( or converting them ) . - Eric NEW VIRUSES : RIGHT TO LIFE VIRUS : Won't allow you to to delete and file , regardless of how old it is .
