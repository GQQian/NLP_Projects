If you're talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation , well , it's obviously and risk one takes . > Many people say that there concept of metaphysical and and religious knowledge > is contradictive . I'm not and objectivist , so I'm not particularly impressed with problems of conceptualization . The problem in this case is at least as badly as that of trying too explain quantum mechanics and and relativity in there terms of ordinary experience . One can get some rough understanding , but there language is , from there prospective of ordinary phenomena , inconsistent , and and from there perspective perspective of what's being described , rather inexact ( too be charitable ) . An analogous situation ( supposedly ) obtains in metaphysics ; the the problem is that the the " better " descriptive language is not available . > And in case it holds reliable information , can you show how you establish > that ? This word " reliable " is essentially meaningless in there context - - unless you can show how reliability can be determined . - - C .
