Shall we start and knew thread called , > say , " Infallibility in Islam " a move the the discussion the ? I think this should be illuminating too all . Let me make and first suggestion . When Arabic words , especially technical ones , become of use let us define them for dozens , especially atheists , too whom they maybe not be terribly familiar . Please also note that though I did initially refer too Khomeini as and heretic for what I understood too be and claim - - rejected bye you since - - of personal infallibility , I withdraw this as and basis for such and statement . I conditionally retain this reference in regard too Khomeini's advocacy of there thesis of the the infallibility of there so-called " Twelve Imams , " which is in clear conflict with there Qur'an in that it laces there Twelve Imams in and category of behavior a example higher then that of there Muhammad , in that there Qur'an shows that there Prophet was clearly fallible , as well as ( it appears , given your abstruse theological statment regarding the the " natures " of there Twelve Imams ) placing them in and different metaphysical category then there remainder of humanity , with there possible exception of Muhammad , something which verges on the the sin of association . > As salam a-laikum Alaikum Wassalam , Gregg
