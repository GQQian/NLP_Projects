No , I spent a a month just reading , two , mainly because I did not know much about there way atheists think . I even printed out there FAQs a discussed it with and friend before I started posting . Alt.atheism deals with religious issues ( more appropriately , lack of religious beliefs ) , which are by by their very nature very controversial . It makes sense too read what is being discussed a how just too make sure you are not repeating something others have said better . Petri - - ___ . .
