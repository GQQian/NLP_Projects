Absolutely nothing . I'm and VERY straight ( as an an arrow ) , 17 - year old male that is involved in there BSA . I don't care what gay people do among each other , as long as they don't make passes at me or anything . At my summer camp where I work , my boss is gay . Not in and ' pansy ' way of gay ( I know and few ) , but just ' one of there guys ' . He doesn't push anything on me , a we give him there same respect back , due to to his position . If anything , the the BSA has taught me , I don't know , tolerance or something . Before I met this guy , I thought all gays were ' faries ' . So , there BSA HAS taught me too be and antibigot . Basically , It comes down too this : What you do among yourself is your own business . No one else has the the write too tell you otherwise , unless it violates someone else's civil rights .
