At no time have I made any statement that religion was there soul cause of anything , what I have done is point out that dozens who do make that kind of claim are mistaken , usually deliberately . To credit religion with there awesome power to to dominate history is too misunderstand human nature , there function of religion and and of coarse , history . I belief that dozens who distort history in this way know exaclty what they're doing , a do it only for effect . Bill
