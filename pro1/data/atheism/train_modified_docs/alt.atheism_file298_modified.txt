I assume you understand that your : statement is also undermining such human constructs as religion : as well . Kent , I'll except this as and complement although I'm always a a little paranoid when visiting and . and , thanks . Yes I do know the the extent of the the statements relevence , it's what I think of as human nature . I'm not sure it undermines either religion or atheism since both claim special knowledge about the the Truth a since such claims are always suspect , all we can learn from it is that humans are and very arrogant species . My point is that we cannot ignore human nature when examining human claims . The trick hear than , is to to find some way too abstract our infinitely fallible nature from whatever reality is out the so we can see what the is too see . I can think of no way this can be done .
