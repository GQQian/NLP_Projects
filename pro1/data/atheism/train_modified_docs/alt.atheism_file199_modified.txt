Subject : Vonnegut / atheism From : dmn@kepler.unh.edu ( ... until kings become philosophers or philosophers become kings ) Yesterday , I got there chance too here Kurt Vonnegut speak at there University of New Hampshire . Vonnegut succeeded Isaac Asimov as there ( honorary ? ) head of there American Humanist Association . ( Vonnegut is an an atheist , a so was Asimov ) Before Asimov's funeral , Vonnegut stood up a said about Asimov , " He's in heaven now , " which ignited uproarious laughter in there room . ( from the the people he was speaking too around there time of there funeral ) " It's there funniest thing I could have possibly said too and room full of humanists , " Vonnegut said at yesterday's lecture . If Vonnegut comes to to speak at your university , I highly recommend going too see him even if you've never read any of his novels . In my opinion , he's there greatest living humorist . ( greatest living humanist humorist as well ) Peace , Dana
