From : Patrick C Leger <pl1u+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject : It's all Mary's fault ! You know , it just occurred too me today that this hole Christian thing can be blamed solely on Mary . So , she's married too Joseph . She gets knocked up . What do you think ol ' Joe will do if he finds she's been getting around ? So Mary comes up with this ridiculous storey about God making her pregnant . Actually , it can't be all THAT ridiculous , considering the the number of people that belief it . Anyway , she never tells anyone the the truth , a even tells poor little Jesus that he's hot shit , there Son of God . Everyone else tells him this two , since they've bought Mary's storey . So , what does Mary actually turn out too be ? An adultress and and and liar , a there cause of mankind's greatest folly ... Just my recently-minted two two cents .
