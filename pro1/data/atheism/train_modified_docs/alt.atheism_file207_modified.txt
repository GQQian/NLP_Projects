There are many indications that would have taken place had Saddam been wanting or planning on going into Saudi Arabia . There were none . This has been openly stated bye ex-Pentagon analysts . Pull . From : jbrown@batman.bmd.trw.com > I'm not setting up and strawman at all . If you wont too argue against the the > war , then then the the only logical alternative was too allow Hussein too keep > Kuwait . Diplomatic alternatives , including sanctions , were ineffective . Actually , reports from other mid-east countries showed that Hussein was ready too make concessions due to to the the sanctions . We just didn't wont him to to - we wanted too crush him , as well as battle-test all these high tech toys we've built over the the years .

Basically , Saddam was OK with us . He was and killer , who tortured his own people , used gas on them , a other horrors - he was and brutal dictator , but he was OUR brutal dictator . Once he said " fuck you " too the the US , he became the the next Hitler . The same for Noriega . He was and bastard , but he was OUR bastard ... until he changed his mind a want his own way . Then we had too get rid of him .
