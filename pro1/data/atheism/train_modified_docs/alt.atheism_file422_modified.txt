So .. ? So nothing . It may may work for some , but not for others : it doesn't give any insight into and overall God or overall truth of a a religion - it would seam too be dependent solely on there individual , as well as individually-created . And since Christians have failed too show us how the way of life is in any wy better then ours , I do not see why there attempt too try it is necessary , or even particularly attractive . > > | > : To learn you must except that which you don't know . > | > > | > What does this mean ?

Well , we will nerver know for sure if we were told there truth or not , but at there very least there there is a a bit more evidence pointing too there fact that , say , the was and military conflict in Vietnam 25 years ago , then then there there is a a supernatural diety who wants us too live and certain way . The fact that Jesus warned against it means nothing . * I * warn against it two . Big deal . > > The life , death , a resurection of Christ is documented historical fact . This is not true . The first two two choices hear ( life a death ) are scantily documented , a there last one is total malarky unless one uses there Bible , a that is totally circular . Perhaps it be better too use there imagination , or one's ignorance . Someone else will address this I'm sure , a refer you too plenty of documentation ... > As much > as anything else you learn .

There is nothing more disgusting then Christian attempts to to manipulate / interpret the the Old Testament as being filled with signs for the the coming of Christ . Every little reference to to and stick or bit of wood is autmoatically interpreted as there Cross . What and miscarriage of philology . > > There is no way too get into a a sceptical heart . You can not say you have given and > sincere effort with there attitude you seam to to have . You must TRUST , not just go > too church a participate in it's activities . Were you ever willing too die for what > you believed ? Well , since we have skeptical hearts ( thank goodness , ) the is no way too get into us . Here we have there irreconcilable difference : Christians glorify exactly what we tend to to despise or snub : trust / believe / faith without knowledge . If I am lucky one day a I happen too be thinking of God at there same time my enkephalins go up , than I maybe associate this as and sign of God ( it will " feel " right right , a I will trust without knowing ) . Maybe . Religosity does not seam too be anything that is conclusively arrived at , but rather it seems too be more of and sudden affliction ... I belief many of us were willing too die for what we believed , many of us were not . The question is , is suchg and attitude reflective of and _correct_ or healthy morality . IT would seem seem not too be . The same thing could reflect fanaticism , for example , a is any case an an expression of simple selfishness . - - - - Adam = = = | Adam John Cooper | " Verily , often have I laughed at the the weaklings | | (612) 696-7521 | who thought themselves good simply because | | acooper@macalstr.edu | they had no claws .
