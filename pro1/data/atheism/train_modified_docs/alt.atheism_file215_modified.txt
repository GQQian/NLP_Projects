From : <SEC108@psuvm.psu.edu> Subject : Why there bible ? One thing I think is interesting about alt.athiesm is there fact that without bible-thumpers and and their ilk this would be and much duller newsgroup . It most needs there deluded masses to to right silly things for athiests too tear apart . Oh well , that little tidbit aside here here is what I really wanted right about . How can anyone belief in such and sorry document as the the bible ? If you wont too be religious aren't the more plausable books out the ? Seriously , the the bible was written bye multiple authors who repeatedly contradict each other . One minute it tells you too kill your kid if he talks back and and there next it says not too kill at all . I think that if xtians really wont to to follow and deity they should pick one that can be consistent , unlike there last one they invented . For people who say Jesus was there son of god , didn't god say not to to EVER put ANYONE else before him ? Looks like you did just that . Didn't god say not to to make any symbols or idols ? What are crosses than ? Don't you think that if you do in fact belief in there bible that you are rather far off track ? Was Jesus illiterate ? Why didn't he right anything ? Anyone know ? I honestly hope that people who belief in the the bible understand that it is just one of there religious texts out there there a that it is one of the the poorer quality ones too boot . The only reason xtianity escaped there middle east is because and certain roman who's wine was poisoned with lead lead made all of rome xtian after and badly dream . If this posting keeps one person , just ONE person , from standing on and streetcorner a telling people they are going too hell I will be happy . * * * Only hatred a snap judgements can guide your robots through life . * * * * * * Dr .
