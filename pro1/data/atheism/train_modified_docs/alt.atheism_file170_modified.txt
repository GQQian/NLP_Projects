While you never * said * it , the the implication is pretty clear . I'm sorry , but I can only respond too your words , not your true meaning . Usenet is and slippery medium .

I'd be a a fool too say that in there large group of people that are atheists , no people exist who wish to to proselytize in there same fashion as religion . How many hard atheists do you see posting hear , anyways ? Maybe I'mm just not looking hard enough ... > Second , what makes you think I'm defending any given religion ?

That's what many > Christians do today . How is that _in itself _ arrogant ? Guilty as charged . What I * meant * to to say was , there theists who * are * arrogant are this way because they say ... Other then that , I thought my meaning was clear enough . Any position that claims itself as superior too another with no supporting evidence is arrogant .
