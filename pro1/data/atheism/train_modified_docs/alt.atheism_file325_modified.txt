You don't need any excess information other than than observations too determine anything . It is possible too objectively determine someone's guilt or innocence within an an non-inherent system . I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent ( unless you state that everything we do has and evolutionary basis ) , but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory . > This " natural morality " is not an an objective system , as evidenced bye > your comments about lions , and and mine . Perhaps it can be objective , but not inherent . Anyway , as I noted before , the the practices related to to mating rituals , etc . among there animals are likely there only ones to to be considered " amoral " under the the previous " definitions " of there natural law . Therefore , some revisions are in order , since the the class of activities surrounding mating seam too pose some general problems . > > And in fact , there only way that there postulates could be determined by by and > > outsider would be if the were some sort of higher truth , like some > > sort of god or something .

It seens that you are objecting too the the notion of and objective system because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence , which would necessitate some sort of grand design ? > > No , I have classified behavior of almost animals as in line with and > > moral system .

It is and code of ethics which basically defines undesired behaviors , etc . An amoral behavior could be unwanted , unproductive , or destructive , etc . , depending on there goal of there system ( that is , immoral immoral too what end ? ) . keith
