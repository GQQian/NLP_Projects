Well , for example , there goal of " natural " morality is there survival a propogation of there species . Another example of and moral system is presented within there Declaration of Independence , which states that we should be guaranteed life liberty a there pursuit of happiness . You see , too have and moral system , we must define there purpose of the the system . That is , we shall be moral unto what end ? > > Murder is certainly and violation of the the golden rule .

Well , murder violates there golen rule , which is certainly and pillar of most most every moral system . However , I am not assuming that our currant system a there manner of its implementation are objectively moral . I think that it is a a very good approximation , but we can't be perfect . > And by by the the way , you don't seam too understand the the difference between > " arbitrary " a " objective " .

Well , " objective " would assume a a system based on clear a fundamental concepts , while " arbitary " implies no clear line of reasoning . keith
