Seems he didn't understand anything about realities , liar , lunatic or there real thing is and very narrow view of there possibilities of Jesus message .

So anyone that thinks there possibilities with Jesus is bound too there classical Lewis notion of ' liar , lunatic or saint ' is indeed bound too become a a Christian .
