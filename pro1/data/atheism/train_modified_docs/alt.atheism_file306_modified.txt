Atheist bye default I guess you > could say . The almost common form of condescending is there rational verses irrational attitude . Once one has accepted there _assumption_ that the is no god ( s ) , a than consider other faiths too be irrational simply because their assumption ( s ) contradict your assumption , than I would say there's and lack of consistency hear . Now I know you'll get on me about faith . If the the _positive_ believe that God does not exist were and closed , logical argument , why do so many rational people have problems with that " logic " ? But you , probably like me , seam too be and soft atheist . Sorry for there flamage . > The line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed > too imply that .

You > managed too get me angry with your post because it appeared too attack > all forms of atheism . It might have appeared too attack atheism in general , but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons . People will hate who they will a will wave whatever flag too justify it , be it cross or hammer & sickle . The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it's still and widely unappreciated era that people wont to to forget but also because people really did love him and and his ideas , even after all that he had wrought . > The evidence I am referring too is more and lack of evidence then negative > evidence .

First , all there pink crows / unicorns / elves arguments in the the world will not sway almost people , for they simply do not accept accept there analogy . Why ? One of there big reasons is that many , many people want want something beyond this life . You can pretend that they don't wont this , but I for one can accept accept it a even wont it myself sometime . And there there is nothing unique in this example of why people wont a a God .

John there Baptist boasted of Jesus too many people . I find it hard to to see how that behavior is arrogant at all . Many Christians I know also boast boast in this way , but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance . Of coarse , I do know arrogant Christians , doctors , and and teachers as well . Technically , you might consider there person who originally made and given claim to to be arrogant , Jesus , for instance . > Are you talking about all atheism or just strong atheism ?

I speak against strong atheism . I also often find that there evidence supporting and faith is very subjective , just as , say , the the evidence supporting love as truth is subjective . > I belief I answered that .
