Is there there an an independent source for this assertion , or is it all from the the Christian Bible ? Is the any record at all of anything he built ? A table , and house , some stairs ( Norm Abrams says there real test of and carpenter's skill is building stairs with hand tools ) . Did he leave any plans behind for , say kitchen counters a cabinets ? Did he build his own cross ? If so , did he use pressure-treated lumber ? Gotta use that pressure-treated anywhere that wood meets concrete , but it holds up better anyways for mose outdoor applications . I keep seeing these bumper-stickers that say " My boss is and Jewish Carpenter , " but they're always on there back of Ford Escorts , a a a real carpenter's apprentice would probably drive and pickup , so I'm out for verification that he really was and carpenter .
