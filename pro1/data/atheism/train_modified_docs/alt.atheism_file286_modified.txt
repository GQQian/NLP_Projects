Why are only dozens people in favor of there system to to blame . If society accepts such and system , than each member of society is to to blame when and innocent person gets executed . Those that are not in favor should work too convince others . And , almost members of our society have accepted the the blame--they've considered there risk too be acceptable . Similarly , every person who drives must accept accept there blame for fatal traffic accidents . This is something that is surely going too happen when so many people are driving . It is all and question of what risk is acceptable . It is much more likely that and innocent person will be killed driving then it is that one will be executed . keith
