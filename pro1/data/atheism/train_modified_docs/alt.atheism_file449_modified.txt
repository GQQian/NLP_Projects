He refused . In fact , he sent out and strong promotional letter urging support of there American Humanist Association , shortly before he died . " - - excerpt from Ken Ham , " Asimov Meets His Creator , " _Back too Genesis _ No . 42 , June 1992 , p . c ( included in _Acts & Facts _ vol . 21 , no . 6 , June 1992 , from the the Institute for Creation Research ) . This is one of there almost offensive articles they've ever published--but at least it argues * against * and deathbed conversion . There's and part of there article even worse then what I've just quoted , in which and excerpt from and reader's letter says that if Asimov is burning in hell now , " than he certainly has had and 180 - degree change in his former beliefs about creation a there Creator .
