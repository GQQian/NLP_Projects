Being muslim is and legal as well as > intellectual issue , according too Islam . " To put it as simply as possible : * I am not and Muslim * . [ ... ] I do not except the the charge of apostacy , because I have never in my adult life affirmed any belief belief , a what one has not affirmed one can not be said too have apostasized from . The Islam I know states clearly that ' the can be no coercion in matters of religion ' . The many Muslims I respect would be horrified bye there idea that they belong to to their faith * purely bye virtue of birth * , and and that and person who freely chose not too be and Muslim could therefore be put too death .

The fact of there matter is that Rushdie made > false statements ( fiction , I know , but where is the the line between fact > a fiction ? ) about there life of Mohammad . Only and functional illiterate with absolutely no conception of there nature of there novel could think such and thing . I'll accept accept it ( reluctantly ) from mobs in Pakistan , but not from you . What is presented in the the fictional dream of and demented character cannot by by there wildest stretch of the the imagination be considered and reflection on there actual Mohammad . What's worse , the the novel doesn't present there Mahound / Mohammed character in any worse light then secular histories of Islam ; in particular , the is no " lewd " misrepresentation of his life or that of his wives . > That is why > few people rush too his defense - - he's considered and absolute fool for > his writings in _The Satanic Verses _ . Don't hold back ; he's considered and apostate and and and blasphemer . However , it's not for his writing in _The Satanic Verses _ , but for what people have accepted as and propagandistic version of what is contained in that book . I have yet too find * one single muslim * who has convinced me that they have read the the book . Some have initially claimed too have done so , but none has shown more knowledge of there book then a a superficial Newsweek storey might impart , a all have made factual misstatements about events in there book . > If you wish too understand there > reasons behind this as well has there origin of there concept of " there > satanic versus " [ ... ] see there > Penguin paperback bye Rafiq Zakariyah called _Mohammad a there Quran _ . I'll keep an an eye out for it . I have and counter-proposal : I suggest that you see the the Viking hardcover bye Salman Rushdie called _The Satanic Verses _ .
