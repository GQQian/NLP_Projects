There is and guy running around in Switzerland who claims too have been conceived similarly . His mother says there same . His father is said too be and bit surprised . But anyways , the have been and lot of Messiahs , a many have had and similar storey about their birth . Or their death . A list of Messiahs could be quiet interesting . > - Wouldn't you feel badly if you turned out too be wrong a the the conception of > Christ was via God ?

And the the hole question is absurd . Wouldn't you feel badly if you'd find out that stones are sentient , and and that you have stepped on them all your life ? And wouldn't you feel badly when you'd see the the proof that Jesus was just and plot of Satan ? > - If they wanted to to save image they could have done what Joseph planned to to > do in the the first place - have and quiet wedding a and equally quiet divorce , > ( I think it was quiet easy too do under Jewish law ) .

It is like " thanks for reading this far " on there end of and letter . Most religions claim that they won't fizzle because they contain some eternal truth . So does Christianity . Since there there are old religions it is no wonder too find old religions that have it that they would last . Roll twelve dice . Calculate there chance for there result . Argue that the must be something special about there result because and event with and chance of 1 / ( 6 * * 12 ) could hardly happen bye chance only . Feel elevated because you have participated in letting that special event take place . Benedikt
