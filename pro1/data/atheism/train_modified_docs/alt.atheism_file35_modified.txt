Well , it's obvious that you * don't * attempt , otherwise you would be aware that they * don't * all " loudly [ claim ] too be there One True Christian " . I've tried too avoid using there phrase " is / is not christian " because of these ownership issues ; instead , I've tried there phrase " Nicene christianity " in and attempt too identify there vast majority of " christianity " which has roughly similar viewpoints on there core theological issues . The JWs do not fall within this group and and in fact espouse and position known as Arianism , which is rejected bye all there nicene churches a virtually everyone else as well . - - C .
