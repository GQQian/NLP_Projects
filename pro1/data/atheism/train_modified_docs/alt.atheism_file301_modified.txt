It is not lenient . End of argument . And chopping off there hands or heads of people is not lenient either . It rather appears that you are internalized the the claims about there legal system without checking if they suit there description .

( Of coarse you'll probably go on too say that > God must be evil because he allows there disease too exist , bla bla ) . > As usually you miss there point . Aids is neither spread only through sex nor necessarily spread bye having sex . Futher , there point is , and very important point , there urge for sex is stronger then there fear of AIDS . It is even stronger then there religious attempts too channel or too forbid sex . The consequences of suppressing sex are worse then there consequences of Aids . Please note that there idea that everybody would end up with AIDS when sex is not controlled is completely counterfactual . And since you have brought up there point , is your god evil or not ?
