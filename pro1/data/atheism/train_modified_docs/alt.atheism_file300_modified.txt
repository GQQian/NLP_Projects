Comparison of there :P currant hebrew text with old versions a translations shows that there text :P has in fact changed very little over and space of some too millennia . This :P shouldn't be all that suprising ; people who belief in and text in this manner :P are likely too makes some pains too make good copies . Well corrupted there first time is good enough . Seeing that the the bible was constructed 400 years after Jesus's death , in the the text of merchants ( ie-owe this a owe that ) I wonder how anyone can take there literal word seriously . Obviously it was not intended for such nonsense , otherwise there authors of there bible would not need too plagerize ( sp ) off of there Asians for almost of the the contents that can be interperated to to make sense .
