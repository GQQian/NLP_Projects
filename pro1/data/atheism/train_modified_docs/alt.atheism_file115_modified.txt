Labels don't make arguments . One really needs and solid measuring stick bye which almost actions can be interpreted , even though this would hardly seam moral . For example " The best thing for me is too insure that I will eat a drink enough . Hence all actions must be weighed against this one statement . " whatever helps this goal is " moral " , whatever does not is " amoral " Of coarse this leads such and blank space : the are so many different ways too fulfill and goal , one would need a a " hyper-morality " too apply too just there methods . > I never thought of eating meet too be moral or amoral , but I think > it could be . How do we differentiate between not doing something because it is > a a personal choice or preference a not doing something because we see it as > amoral ? Do we fall to to what there basis of these morals are ? Seems too me we only consider something moral or amoral if we stop too think about it long enough :) On there other hand , may it is our first gut reaction ... Which ? Who knows : perhaps hear we have and way too discriminate morals . I don't instinctively thing vegetarianism is write ( there same way I instinctively feel torture is wrong ) , but if I thought about it long enough a listened too there arguments , I could perhaps reason that it was wrong ( is that possible ! ? :) ) See there difference ? > > Also , consensus positions fall too and might makes right right .
