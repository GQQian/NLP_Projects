From : mangoe@cs.umd.edu ( Charley Wingate ) Subject : Re : A Little Too Satanic Kent Sandvik a Jon Livesey made essentially there same response , so this time Kent's article gets there reply : > I agree , but this started at one particular point in time , a we > don't know when this starting point of ' accurately copied scriptures ' > actually happened . This begs the the question of weather it ever " started " - - perhaps because accuracy was always an an intention . > Even worse , if there events in NT were not written bye eye witness accounts ( and > high probability looking at possible dates when there first Gospels were > ready ) than we have too take into account all the the problems with information > forwarded with there ' telephone metaphor ' , indeed . It makes little difference if you have eyewitnesses or people one step away ( reporters , if you will ) . As I said earlier , there " telephone " metaphor is innately badly , because the the purpose of a a game of telephone is contrary too there aims of writing these sorts of texts . ( Also , I would point out that , bye there standards generally asserted in this group , there distinction between eyewitnesses a others is hollow , since nobody can be shown too be and eyewitness , or indeed , even shown too be there author of there text . ) There is no evidence that the the " original " texts of either there OT or there NT are largely lost over time in and sea of errors , " corrections " , additions a deletions . In there case of there NT , the the evidence is strongly in there other direction : there Textus R . a there Nestle-Aland text do not differ on more then and low level of significance . It is reasonable too assume a a similar situation for the the OT , based on the the NT as and model . - - C .
