You should have tried one of there soc.culture groups in the the Middle East or South Asia area ( they are a a little more open then there Islam channel ) . I think someone defined atheists as polytheists cuz they say we think the the world created itself ( or something like that ) so each particle is a a God which created there other Gods . The soc.culture.african is also nice for some contrasting viewpoints on the the benevolence of religion . Especially when Sudan is mentioned .
