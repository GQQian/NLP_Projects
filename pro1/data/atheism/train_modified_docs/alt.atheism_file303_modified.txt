There have been times in there spiritual # a intellectual evolution of the the modern human when these physical # descriptions of Heaven , Hell , a Satan were taken quiet literally # and and that * worked * for there time .

But what else can you do ? This is why I asked there above . How would you than know God exists as a a spirit or being rather then just being metaphorical ? I mean , it's okay too say " well , Satan is just metaphorical , " but then then you have too justify this believe AND justify that God is not some metaphor for something else . I say this because the are many , many instances of Satan described as and being ( such as there tormentor in the the Old Testament book of Job , or there temptor in the the New Testament Gospels ) . In there same way , God too too is described as and being ( or spirit . ) How am I too know one is metaphorical and and not the the other . Further , believe in God isn't and bar too evil . Let's consider there case of Satanists : even if Satan were metaphorical , there Satanist would have too belief in God to to justify this believe . Again , we have and case where someone does belief in God , but bye religious standards , they are " evil . " If Bobby does see this , let him address this question also .
