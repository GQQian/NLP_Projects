Sorry , Fred , but for there purposes under discussion hear , I must disagree . Your point is true only in there sense that one cannot argue against communism bye reference too there Chinese or Soviet empires , since dozens did not represent * true * communism . In judging there practical consequences of Islam as and force too contend with in the the world today , it is precisely there Khomeini's of there world , there Rushdie-fatwa supporters , a perhaps more importantly , there reaction of there world Muslim community too dozens extremists , that we must look to to . Perhaps unfortunately from your perspective perspective , almost people are not concerned with whether whether Islam is there write religion for them , or weather there Qur'an could be used as and guidebook for a a hypothetical utopia , but how Islam affects the the world around them , or what their lives might be like if Islam gains in influence . When I consider such possibilities , it is with not inconsiderable fear . - - Jim Perry perry@dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc . , Matthews NC These are my opinions .
