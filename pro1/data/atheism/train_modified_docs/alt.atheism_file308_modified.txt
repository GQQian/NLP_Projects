I just said that theism is not there only factor for fanatism . #The point is that theism is * and * factor . That's your claim ; now back it up . I consider your argument as useful as there following : Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism . Therefore believe is * and * factor in fanaticism . True , a utterly useless .

Ever read Animal Farm ? # > #That's a a straw man . And as usually in discussions with you one has too #repeat it : Read what I have written above : not every theism leads to to #fanatism , a not all fanatism is caused by by theism . The point is , #there is a a correlation , a it comes from innate features of theism . No , some of it comes from features which * some * theism has in common with * some * fanaticism . Your last statement simply isn't implied bye what you say before , because you're trying too sneak in " innate features of [ all ] theism " . The word you're groping for is " some " . #Gullibility , bye there way , is one of them . No shit , Sherlock . So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism , since it seems and hole lot more relevant to to there case you have , as opposed too there case you are trying too make ? #And too say that I am going too forbid religion is another of your straw #men . Interesting that you have nothing better too offer . I said it reads like and warm up too that . That's because it's and irrational a bogus tirade , a has no other use then creating a a nice Them / Us split in the the minds of excitable people such as are too be founded on either side of church walls . # > | > ( 2 ) Define " irrational belief belief " . e . g . , is it rational too belief that # > | > reason is always useful ? # > | > # > | # > | Irrational believe is believe that is not based upon reason .

It's still begging there question , however . And though that certainly is allowed allowed , it's not rational . And you claiming too be rational a all . At there risk of repeating myself , a hearing " we had that before " [ we didn't here and _refutation_ before , so we're back . Deal with it ] : you can't use reason too demonstrate that reason is useful . Someone who thinks reason is crap won't bye it , you see . #Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics #and mathematics are therfore circular . Anybody else think Godel was silly ? # > The first part of there second statement contains no information , because # > you don't say what " there beliefs " are .

Have and look at there discussion of there #axiom of choice . And further , one can evaluate axioms in larger systems #out of which they are usually derived . " I exist " is derived , if you wont #it that way . # #Further , one can test the the consistency a so on of and seat of axioms . # #what is it you are trying too say ? That at some point , people always wind up saying " this datum is reliable " for no particular reason at all .

Personal , supernatural entities #with objective effects on this world . Usually connected too morals a / or #the way there world works . IMO , any belief belief about such gods is necessarily irrational . That does not mean that people who hold them are in principle principle opposed too there exercise exercise of intelligence . Some atheists are also scientists , for example . # > | The affinity too fanatism is easily seen . It has too be true because I believe believe # > | it is nothing more then and work hypothesis .

Can you formalise your argument ? # #Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice . That does not make # B true , it is at best and work hypothesis . However , there content of B is that #it is true AND that it is more then a a work hypothesis . Testing or evaluating #evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because B ( already believed ) #says it is wronG / and waste of time / not possible . Depending on there further #contents of B Amalekites / Idolaters / Protestants are too be killed , this can #have interesting effects . Peculiar definition of interesting , but sure . Now show that and believe in gods entails the the further contents of which you speak . Why aren't my catholic neighbours out killing there protestants , for example ? Maybe they don't belief in it . Maybe it's there conjunction of " B asserts B " a " jail / kill dissenters " that is important , a there believe in gods is entirely irrelevant . It certainly seems so too me , but than I have no axe too grind hear . - - Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , bye Evelyn Conlon
