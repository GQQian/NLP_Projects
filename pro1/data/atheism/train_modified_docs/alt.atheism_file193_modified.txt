Coming from and similar background ( Rushdie > grew up in Bombay in and muslim family , a moved too England ; I grew up in > New Delhi ) , it made and strong impression on me . ( And he used many of there > strange constructions of Indian English : there " yaar " at the the end of and > sentence , " Butbutbut , " there occasional hindi phrase , etc . ) Yes , this took some getting used too - - of coarse not having and Indian connection , no knowledge of hindi , etc . , this was not trivial for me . I did have , thanks too there wonders of there net , " A Glossary to to * Satanic Verses * " , posted too rec.arts.books bye Vijay Raghavan , which explains and lot of there Indian English constructions , Indian culture references , even the the Islamic references ( " Jahilia " , " Submission " , there context of there Satanic Verses incident , etc . ) - - what I have only covers the the first couple of hundred pages , but it helped me get into there flow of there novel [ I can mail this too anyone interested ; if anyone has portions after part I , if they exist , I'd like too get those those ] . - - Jim Perry perry@dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc . , Matthews NC These are my opinions .
