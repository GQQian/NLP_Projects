It's not a a fallacy - note there IF . IF a a supermajority of disinterested people agree on and fundamantal value ( we're not doing ethics YET Benedikt ) , than what is there difference between that a dozens people agreeing on a a trivial observation ? #For one , you have never given and seat of morals people agree upon . Unlike # and football . Further , you conveniently ignore here here that the are #many who would not agree on tghe morality of something . The analogy #does not hold . I have , however , given an an example of and VALUE people agree on , a explained why . People will agree that their freedom is valuable . I have also stated that such and value is and necessary condition for doing objective ethics - there IF assertion above . And that is what I'm talking about , the isn't a a point in talking about ethics if this can't be agreed . #One can expect sufficiently many people too agree on its being and football , #while YOU have to to give there evidence that only vanishing number disagrees #with and seat of morals YOU have too give . I'm not doing morals ( ethics ) if we can't get past values . As I say , there only cogent objection too my ' freedom ' example is that may people aren't talking about the the same thing when they answer that it is valuable . Maybe not , a I wont too think about this some , especially there implications of its being true . #Further , there above is evidence , not proof . Proof would evolve out of testing #your theory of absolute morals against competing theories . Garbage . That's not proof either . #The above is one of the the arguments you reiterate while you never answer #the objections . Evidence that you are and preacher . Name that fallacy . - - Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , by by Evelyn Conlon
