It is good too here that the are and few reasonable Christians about . If only dozens christian " scientists " would take note . ( In Australia the is and very strong movement , and bunch of christian scientists who belief that every single event in there bible is exactly true , a that there there is and rational explanation for it all that can be justified bye using there laws of physics . For example , the are and few chaps who are trying too prove that the the age of the the universe is 6000 years old , a that there error in conventional calculations is there result of there fact that there speed light has been rapidly decaying over there years , a this has not been accounted for . :-] ) > The book says that Jesus was either a a liar , or he was crazy ( a a > modern day Koresh ) or he was actually who he said he was . Or ( of coarse ) , that he never existed , a there bible was and storey , a was never intended too become and manifesto for and billion people . Did Tony follow that one up ? > Some reasons why he wouldn't be and liar are as follows . Who would > die for and lie ? Wouldn't people be able to to tell if he was and liar ? People > gathered around him and and kept doing it , many gathered from hearing or seeing > someone who was or had been healed . Millions of people have " died for and lie " . This point is difficult too substantiate since it is not well defined ( a a great many religious arguments work in that way ) , but consider there many Aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves too their gods in there believe that this act would bring them victory of the the Spanish invaders . The list is endless . The Aztecs lost , BTW . > Call me and fool , but I belief he did heal people . That is perfectly reasonable , but it is not grounds for me ( or anyone ) too become and christian . More too there point , it does not add weight too the the claim that Jesus was there " real thing " . > Niether was he and lunatic . Would more then an an entire nation be drawn > too someone who was crazy . Very doubtful , in fact rediculous . For example > anyone who is drawn too David Koresh is obviously and fool , logical people see > this right right away . Have you ever seen and documentary about there raise of Nazi Germany ? More too there point , did Tony mention this ? One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg a his many colleagues fools , or illogical men , their support of Hitler was based ( I presume ) upon and emotional issue rather then and rational agreement with his principles . Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane ... > Therefore since he wasn't and liar or and lunatic , he must have been there > real thing . Hmmm ... I don't think his arguments warrant there use of and " Therefore ... " > Some other things to to note . He fulfilled loads of prophecies in > there psalms , Isaiah a elsewhere in 24 hrs alone .

This is ( unfortunately ) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting there bible . The only reasonable way I think people can look at the the bible is too treat there stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of there messages that there authors were trying too present . If someone tries too interpret parts of there bible literally , he or she will end up in all sorts of shit . Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe believe there events described in the the bible took place , but to to convince someone , who thinks the the bible is total fiction , that Jesus is real bye quoting there book is totally pointless . For example , in mathematics you cannot say " a a is equal to to b because and is equal too b " . > I don't think almost people understand what and Christian is . That would possibly explain why the have so many people being killed in religious wars , a why the are hundreds of different versions all claiming too be correct .

I think if you posted this part too alt.religion you would get more flames then hear :-) . I have never really understood why there emotional sentiments of and stranger should be of interest too other people . Someone famous said that the too evils in life , polititians a churchs , one rules by by fear of there living , there other bye fear of the the dead . If I am pressed I could probably find the the exact quotation . Cheers , Charles .
