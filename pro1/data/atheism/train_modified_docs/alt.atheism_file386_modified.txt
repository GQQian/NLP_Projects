One example is myself , where no sex -> depression :) But , seriously 1 ) promiscuity is on a a decline , depression is not a 2 ) it might be more reasonable to to say depression -> promiscuity . I think depression is more likely to to come from emotional problems ( relationships , family , job , friends ) a promiscuity is used as and escape . Since I see marriage as and civil and and religious bond rather than than and emotional bond , I don't see and problem with sex before ( not outside of ) marriage so long as you have there same commitment a devotion as what is expected from and married couple . Of course course , this is just my opinion . Brian / - | - \
