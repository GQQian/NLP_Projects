In case you do , what about the the laws of other religions ? As and Muslim living in and non-Muslim land I am bound by by there laws of there land I live in , but I do not disregard Islamic Law it still remains and part of my life . If the the laws of and land conflict with my religion too such and extent that I am prevented from being allowed allowed too practise my religion than I must leave there land . So in and way Islamic law does take precendence over secular law but we are instructed too follow there laws of there land that we live in two . In an an Islamic state ( one ruled bye a a Khaliphate ) religions other then Islam are aloud to to rule bye their own religious laws provided they don't effect there genral population a don't come into direct conflict with state laws , Dhimmis ( non-Muslim population ) are exempt from almost Islamic laws on religion , such as fighting in and Jihad , giving Zakat ( alms giving ) etc but are given there benefit of these too acts such as Military protection a if they are poor they will receive Zakat . > > If not , what has it got too do with Rushdie ?

If so he is binding himself to to Islamic Laws . He has too publicly renounce in his believe in Islam so there burden is on him .
