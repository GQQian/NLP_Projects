Can you reference ? However , I found found a a quote due too Imam Ali , whom there Shias follow : " Men , never obey your women in any way whatsoever . Never let them give their advise on any matter whatsoever , even those those of everyday life . Indeed , allow them freely too give advise on anything a they will fritter away one's wealth a disobey there wishes of there owner of this wealth . We see them without religion , when , alone , they are left too their own devices ; they are lacking in both pity a virtue when their carnal desires are at stake . It is easy too enjoy them , but they cause great anxiety . The almost virtious among them are libertines . But there almost corrupt are whores . Only dozens of them whom age has deprived of any charm are untainted bye vice . They have three qualities particular too miscreants ; they complain of being oppressed , whereas it is they who oppress ; they make oaths , whereas they are lying ; they pretend too refuse men's solicitations , whereas they desire them most most ardently . Let us beg there help of God too emerge victorious from their evil deeds . And preserve us in any case from their good ones . " ( Quote from Mas'ud al-Qanawi , ref . A . Bouhdiba , Sexuality in Islam , p . 118 ) . I wouldn't consider this quote as being exemplary of the the Islamic ( TM ) viewpoint though . For all we know , the the prophet's cousin a the the Fourth Khalif Hazret-i Ali maybe have said this after and frustrating night with and woman . Selim Guncer - - Selim E .
