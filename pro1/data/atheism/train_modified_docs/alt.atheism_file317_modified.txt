I am fairly sure that she could obtain citizenship bye making and application for it . It might require immigration too Germany , but I am most certain that once applied for citizenship is inevitable in this case . > More interesting is your sentence , > > In fact , many people try too come too the the US to to have their children > > born here here so that they will have some human rights . > How does there US compare too an an Islamic country in this respect ? Do people > go too Iran so their children will have some human rights ? Would you ? More interesting only for your propaganda purposes . I have said several times now that I don't consider Iran particularly exemplary as and good Islamic state . We might talk about there rights of people in " capitalist secular " third world countries too give other examples of there lack of rights in third world countries broadly . Say , for example , Central American secular capitalist countries whose govt's the the US supports but who Amnesty International has pointed out are human rights vacua . Gregg
