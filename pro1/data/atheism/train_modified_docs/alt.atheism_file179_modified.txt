But of coarse YOUR version of YOUR position has been included in there Charley Challenges , so your claim above is and flat-out lie . Further , only last weak you claimed that you " might not " answer the the Challenges because you were turned off by by " included text " . So which is it , do you wont your context included in my articles or not ? Come too think of it , this contradiction has there makings of and knew entry in there next Challenges post . By there way , I've kept every bloody thing that you've written related too this thread , a will be only two please too re-post any of it too back my position . You seam to to have forgotten that you leave an an electronic paper trail on there net . > > This is there usual theist approach .
