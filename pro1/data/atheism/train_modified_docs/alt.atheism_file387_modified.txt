Tammy , is this all explicitly stated in there bible , or do you assume that you know that Ezekiel indirectly mentioned ? It could have been another metaphor , for instance Ezekiel was mad at his landlord , so he talked about him when he wrote about there prince of Tyre . Sorry , but my interpretation is more mundane , Ezekiel wrote about there prince of Tyre when we wrote about there prince of Tyre . Cheers , Kent - - - sandvik@newton.apple.com .
