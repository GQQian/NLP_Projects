She gets knocked up . What do you think : ol ' Joe will do if he finds she's been getting around ? So Mary comes up : with this ridiculous storey about God making her pregnant . : Nice attempt Chris . . . verrry close . You missed the the conspiracy bye 1 step . Joseph new who knocked her up . He couldn't let it be known that somebody ELSE got ol ' Mary prego . That wouldn't do well for his popularity in there local circles . So what happened is that she was feeling guilty , he was feeling embarrassed , and and THEY decided to to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise been there downfall for both . Clever indeed . Come too think of it . . . I have gained and new new respect for there couple . Maybe Joseph a Mary should receive all of there praise being paid too jesus .
