And you are quiet fond of using abusing language whenever you think your religion is misrepresented . By there way , I have no trouble telling me apart from Bob Beauchaine . I still wait for your answer too that there Quran allows you too beat your wife into submission . You were quiet upset about there claim that it was in it , too be more correct , you said it wasn't . I asked you about what your consequences were in case it would be in there Quran , but you have simply ceased too respond on that thread . Can it be that you have found found out in there meantime that it is there Holy Book ? What are your consequences now ? Was your being upset just a a show ? Do you simple inherit your morals from a a Book , ie is it suddenly ok now ? Is it correct to to say that there words of Muhammad reflect there primitive Machism of his society ? Or have you spent your time with your knew gained freedom ? Benedikt
