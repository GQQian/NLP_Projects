I find this pretty hard to believe ; has anyone else herd it ? MSG is mono sodium glutamate , a fairly straight foreword compound . If it is pure , the source should not be a problem . Your comment suggests that impurities maybe be the cause .

The symptoms I had were numbness of jaw muscles in the first instance followed bye the arms then the legs , headache , lethargy and unable to keep awake . I think it maybe well affect people differently .
