have been stable since 1986 3 . </s>  <s> because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth , a national health objective for the year 2000 4 is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries objective 14.8 . </s>  <s> postpartum complications including urinary tract and wound infections may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than

the year 2000 objective specifies a vbac rate of 35 , based on all women who had a prior cesarean , regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted . </s>  <s> to reach the overall cesarean rate goal , however , increases in the vbac rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate . </s>  <s> one hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery , by requiring a second opinion , and by instituting a peer review process 10 . </s>  <s> other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries public dissemination of physician and hospital specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices and addressing malpractice concerns , which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates

. </s>  <s> speakers also addressed health care delivery for hiv infected patients , and the need to educate the public about what aids is , and how it is acquired . </s>  <s> saliva and salivary
