flowing into the carbs because of the vacuum created by the displacement of the gasoline . </s>  <s> this is the small tube on the bottom of the tank , the large tube is the overflow . </s>  <s> you

<s> when it runs , it runs well . </s>  <s> good point , did not catch this in the original post . </s>  <s> the only other things which come to mind , since this is a gravity feed fuel system , is this . </s>  <s> the fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the 1 carburator . </s>  <s> let suppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the vacuum valve in the fuel petcock . </s>  <s> when it is cold , the hole is open enough to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on , since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas , and as the engine and surrounding area warm up , the hole seals up . </s>  <s> one way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs . </s>  <s> connect a tube of the correct size , preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow , on the output side of the fuel petcock . </s>  <s> remove the control hose from 1 carburator . </s>  <s> make sure the tank is full . </s>  <s> place the valve in the on position and apply vacuum to the control hose , preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge , to check for air leaks . </s>  <s> with vacuum applied , fuel should flow freely . </s>  <s> to see if there is a vent problem , do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed , if it flows a lot faster with the filler cap open , then there may be something in the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog or partially clog the vent . </s>  <s> I have heard of some f2 fuel tanks being replaced to fix this problem . </s>  <s> so the things which might be defective are , the control hose from 1 carb , the petcock valve , and possibly the fuel tank vent . </s>  <s> now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold , then there is something in the carbs screwed up , but there are so many things to check , I would be typing all day to list them all ! </s>  <s> here are a few , with everything back together , apply vacuum to the petcock valve and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow . </s>  <s> open up the airbox and check for

really the only thing we disagree on . </s>  <s> maybe we should agree to disagree ? </s>  <s> ? </s>  <s> ok but I m right ! </s>  <s> the official line here though I do have my doubts about it is that the front brake is applied first , followed by the rear brake , the idea being that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place . </s>  <s> if that s the official line taught in those rider education classes you were refering to , that also don t teach countersteering , I have to question the quality of the classes . </s>  <s> the official line in msf curricula is as I described . </s>  <s> maximum braking is achieved by applying both brakes equally , when the weight distribution is nominally even and both tires have equal normal forces , and easing off on the rear to prevent locking it , and increasing braking on the front , as more traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to weight shift . </s>  <s> the official line you have been taught seems ineffective on the face of it . </s>  <s> applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage of all the traction available to the rear at time 0 , and is halving the available braking power by using only the front at time 0 . </s>  <s> saying , brake until the tire just begins to slide is next to useless advice to a newbie . </s>  <s> he has to go out and slide the tire to find out where that is ! </s>  <s> it also gives him zero information from which to develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and corresponding weight shift develop . </s>  <s> if you don t slide the tyre , you have no way of knowing whether you ve achieved maximum braking or not . </s>  <s> I m not suggesting that you should always aim to brake as hard as you possibly can but if you want to find the limits of the machine , you have to go beyond them . </s>  <s> not necessarily true . </s>  <s> chirping the tire indicates impending lockup on most surfaces , and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate maximum braking . </s>  <s> I agree that totally locking the front occasionally makes one a better rider , but it is a manuver best saved for an experienced rider , unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like code used to use . </s>  <s> in any case , for maximum braking , if as I suggested you aim to keep both wheels just on the point
