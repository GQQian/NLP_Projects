method that would do this in as little time as possible . </s>  <s> I need this for use in a forward raytracing program . </s>  <s> I think that this is a very difficult problem . </s>  <s> to start with , lines and polygons are semi algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points . </s>  <s> here are a few off the cuff ideas . </s>  <s> first , we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated . </s>  <s> now , the jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open and thus non compact regions . </s>  <s> thus , the line lies completely inside the polygon , the line lies completely outside the polygon , or possibly but this will rarely happen the line intersects the polyon . </s>  <s> now , the phrasing of this question says if a line intersects a polygon , so this is a decision problem . </s>  <s> one possibility the decision model approach is to reduce the question to some other well known problem q , and then try to solve q . </s>  <s> an answer to q gives an answer to the original decision problem . </s>  <s> in recent years , many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called postscript . </s>  <s> see postscript language , by adobe systems incorporated , isbn 0 201 1017 9 3 , co . </s>  <s> 1985 . </s>  <s> so , given a line l and a polygon p , we can write a postscript program that draws the line l and the polygon p , and then outputs the answer . </s>  <s> by output , we mean the program executes a command called showpage , which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon . </s>  <s> a quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem q , and thus the original problem . </s>  <s> there are two small problems with this approach . </s>  <s> 1 there is an infinite number of ways to encode l and p into the reduced problem q . </s>  <s> so , we will be forced to invoke the axiom of choice or equivalently , zorn s lemma . </s>  <s> but the use of the axiom of choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days . </s>  <s> 2 more importantly , the question arises as to whether or not the postscript program q will actually output a piece of paper or in other words , will it halt ? </s>  <s> now , postscript is expressive enough to encode everything that a turing machine might do thus the halting problem for postscript is undecidable . </s>  <s> it is quite possible that the original problem will turn out to be undecidable . </s>  <s> I won t even begin to go into other difficulties , such as aliasing , finite precision and running out of ink , paper or both . </s>  <s> a couple of references might be 1 . </s>  <s> principia mathematica . </s>  <s> newton , I . </s>  <s> cambridge

converting between vector formats . </s>  <s> a lot of people ask about converting from hpgl to postscript , or macdraw to cgm , or whatever . </s>  <s> it is important to understand that this is a

pixel is a pixel the basic objects are the same for all image formats . </s>  <s> this is not so for vector formats . </s>  <s> the basic objects circles , ellipses , drop shadowed pattern filled

another . </s>  <s> as far as I know , no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters , but two different hpgl to postscript converters have been posted to comp.sources.misc . </s>  <s> check the index on your nearest archive site . </s>  <s> a related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image from postscript to sun raster format , or hpgl to
