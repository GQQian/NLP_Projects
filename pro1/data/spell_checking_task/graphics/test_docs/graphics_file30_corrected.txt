OK , I don't use CView anymore , but I saw that no one had explaind this " bug " in the thread , so hear goes : It is NOT the fault of CView . It is DOS ! If you leave a file open on a floppy drive , then change the disk a do something which updates or closes that file , you have a good chance of getting part of the directory a FAT from the other disk written to the new disk . This has always been true , a has destroyed data under other programs , not just CView . The only thing CView can do to improve the situation is to try not to leave files open unless it's actively using them ( ie , reading a decoding ) . - - Kevin Martin sigma@rahul.net " I gotta get me another hat .
